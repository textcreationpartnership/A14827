         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>XPERIENCE hath made the caſe cleare, in all ſciences, arts, and profeſsions, wherein hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capacitie doth ſhew the ſoules excellencie, in apprehenſion, diſcourſe, and iudgement of things paſt, preſent, or to come, by inuention, morall coniecture, and wit of man: that theſe fiue Rules hold out as inexpugnable Principles,<note place="margin">The Author in all theſe fiue Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples &amp; certainties of things, of none denyed, doth clearely conuince the Ieſuits faction and all their fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of many groſſe errours: which ignorant people deduct from their abſurd rules, oppoſite to theſe in al things: as that their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall with his companie of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincials, cannot erre: that they cannot faile in their doctrine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the like: that the foundation of their order is a ſtate of moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. All which errours, with many other are impugned by theſe fiue grounds ſet downe, as in a Preface to the particular Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libets here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of all, and denyed of none: to wit. First, that no ground in Diuinitie, no Axiome in Philoſophie, no Maxime in the Law, no Paragraffe in poſitiue Diſcourſe, no Paradoxe amongſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, no Propoſition amongst Schoolemen, no Article of our faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Apoſtles by ſacred OEcumenicall Synode, defined, depoſed, and decided to be thus and none otherwiſe beleeued, and taken vnder paine of damnation: but the ſame may be impugned by a ſeeming reaſonable plea to the contrarie, with arguments of proofe in ſhew holden on a whole day by fine wits, in a ſchoole deſpicion: and the defendant ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled (if of dull and ſlow conceit) that he ſhall haue no reaſon to deny that to be true: (as <hi>verbi gratia:</hi> that blacke is white: that a man is a mouſe: that there is no God at all, &amp;c.) which to auerre to be falſe, he is and will be readie to ſpend his life, and ſhed his deareſt bloud. Secondly, that <hi>bonum &amp; malum,</hi> vertue and vice, religion and hereſie, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in oppoſition one againſt the other, yet haue this concordance by a neceſſarie ſequele inſerted into the ſubiect, wherein they are inherent by proper kind: as if you build vpon proofe of either by examples, the one ſhall ballance and beard out the other in authoritie to the vttermost. Thirdly, that there is no new thing vnder the Sunne, nor any inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wit inuented, but anothers wit can equall it by inuenting the ſame. Fourthly, that there is no certaintie of any thing here on earth, but that the fall and ſtand, the life and death, and the very Periods of times,
<pb facs="tcp:20192:3"/> Kingdomes, Princes, and all ſorts of perſons, hang vpon mutation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration and downefall, knowne to God alone. Fiftly, that <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Principle, ſcil. <hi>Generatio vnius, eſt corruptio alterius,</hi> is ſo perfect a current of time, and plyable to all, not onely phyſicall or naturall, but alſo morall &amp; politicall cadences and vp-reſts, as no excellencie ſo rare but hath beene abaſed, no complexion ſo perfect, but hath bene corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no Maieſtie ſo regall, but hath bene ſubiected: no power ſo great, but hath come to nothing: no foundation ſo firme, ſtrong, and ſure, but hath bene ſhaken, yea and hitherto quite ouerthrowne (vnleſſe it were the impregnable rocke of the Church, which hangs vpon certitude of diuine pillars independent vpon humane chaunce and chaunge:) and no commonwealth, corporation, ſocietie, or ſtate ſo prudent, politicall, and perſpicuous in all things to make them famous, eternized, and their condition of life, gouernment, and order permanent, but haue had their ſates by ſucceeding turns, with a no leſſe fearefull eclipſe of their former fame, then a notable diminution of their wonted glorie.</p>
            <p>Thus came all the mightie Monarchs, Worthies, and Monarchies of the world (as it were by a naturall ſucceſsion of birth and bloud, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluted from the father to the ſonne) to haue their riſe and fall one after another.<note place="margin">He meaneth the continuance of that Monarchie, from <hi>Nimrod</hi> or <hi>Ninus,</hi> to the laſt of <hi>Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> ſon, <hi>vz.

               </gap>r fall, as to be turned out of the proper feature of a man, into the gaſtfull purport of a beaſt: and in the end his Kingdome taken from his houſe, name and line: no face of a commonwealth remaining vnder any <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> title at this day. Then roſe vp the <hi>Perſian</hi> Prince: and where caryed fame her ſayles aloft, but vnder the canapeall beauer of a <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his briefe,<note place="margin">He alludeth to the Maieſtie of King <hi>Darius</hi> in his briefe ſummo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all the worlds Peeres, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſtately Monarchie, to come to his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſt.</note> the renowned Monarch of the world in his dayes: and yet he alſo was caſt off from the higheſt Pyramides of fortunes wheele. For although the now <hi>Perſian Sophie</hi> haue recouered an Aſiaticke imperiall ſtate againe: yet by the folly of <hi>Darius,</hi> his houſe and line, the ſecond Monarchie, whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpoke, was tranſlated from the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> to the <hi>Greekes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then in ſpeciall, the Macedonian <hi>Alexander,</hi> (a ſecond Worthy of the Gentiles) was the glorie of former fame of his own, &amp; wonder of future ages, as the onely admired at Heroes of the world in his dayes. But yet ſuch is the painefull birth of Princes, and ſhort, ſorowfull, and
<pb facs="tcp:20192:3"/> toyleſome life of Monarchs, in their generation and corruption of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and regall ſtates, as <hi>Alexander</hi> after twelue yeares raigne yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to deſtinie in <hi>Babylon,</hi> there conſumed to duſt: his Monarchie was deuided into foure principall (beſides other inferior) members or Empires. And then againe out of that Greekiſh corruption did riſe a Latine generation of a <hi>Romane</hi> Monarchie: which in a tottering ſtate by tract of time, is come vnto that paſſe, wherein we now do ſee it. One while the Romane <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and <hi>Octauians</hi> caryed away the trophees and triumphes of the world, from all people and nations vnder heauen. After them the <hi>Albions</hi> or great <hi>Britons Conſtantine,</hi> merited the renowne to the famous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Iſle: then the worthie <hi>French Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine</hi> got the fame by Martiall prowes and iuſt deſerts to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie ſelfe, people, and nation where he liued. After that againe, the <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> and with them the <hi>Germaines</hi> (where the imperiall triple Crowne of <hi>Caeſar</hi> yet remaines vp and downe) had the praiſe for many yeares together,</p>
            <p>And now hath the <hi>Portingals</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> continued &amp; kept the honours point for Martiall exploits theſe latter yeares: but who ſhall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie away the price in the cadences of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> God only knoweth.</p>
            <p>Thus came the foure Patriarkes of <hi>Hieruſalem, Antioch, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by ſucceſsion of honor, wealth and fame in Gods Church, to riſe and fall one after another: and now all decayed, dead and gone from their auncient ſtate, renowne and dignitie in the Church of God here militant on earth. Thus came all Monaſticall, Heremiticall, and religious orders of Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> of Saint <hi>Baſill,</hi> of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> of Saint <hi>Benedict,</hi> of Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> of Saint <hi>Dominicke,</hi> of Saint <hi>Frances,</hi> of Saint <hi>Clare,</hi> of Saint <hi>Briget,</hi> and ſundrie other religious orders of men and women, to haue their generation and corruption, by the freedome left of God in humane actions and mans choiſe, to be good or bad, vertuous or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to riſe and fall by ſucceſsion, one after another, by merited fame and iuſt deſert, of their life, manners and graces, giuen and employed by them to Gods glorie. In few, thus came the ſpirituall Knighthoods of the Templers, the Knights of Saint <hi>Iohns,</hi> the Knights of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and now of <hi>Malto;</hi> by a lineall ſucceſsion of fame, renowne and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to haue panigericall hiſtories ſet foorth of their prayſes. And the like is of later orders and ſocieties of <hi>Carmeliſts, Carthuſians, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouchians, Theatines, Ieſuits, Bonhommes, &amp;c.</hi> all which ſet vpon
<pb facs="tcp:20192:4"/> the worlds Theater, repreſent a mournfull tragedie of mans miſerie: how like to flowers, they haue now one and then another order, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or ſocietie, burgened, bloſſomed, bloomed and flouriſhed: and yet ſubiect to the fates of free-will in all humane wights: their deriuatiues are ſtrayed abroad, haue left and are gone from the obedience, deuotion, pietie, pouertie, chaſtitie, charitie, humilitie, patience, and religious zeale, which was in the primitiues and founders of their Orders.</p>
            <p>What ſhal we ſay more, the whole body myſticall of Chriſt, conſiſting of the three eſtates, Eccleſiaſticall, Temporall, and Monaſticall, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre the Peripateticall Prince his principle to be true in all things (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon chance and chaunge) concerning the conuerſion of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, people and nations to the Catholike faith. For was not the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or beginning of the Moſaicall law a plaine corruption, fall, and decay of the law of nature: all the Gentiles (preſently vpon the Orient riſe, bright ſhine, and flouriſh of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Church, and their <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Monarchie) being giuen ouer into infidelitie and Idolatrie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the law of nature, vnder which the faithfull had liued aboue two thouſand yeares, without diſtinction of Iew or Gentile, vntill this Moſaicall law began. And when for the Iewes ſinnes and offences, the period of their Monarchie, and end of their ſynagogues and temples, honour and religion came, did not then the primitiues of the Eaſt Church amongſt the Chriſtians carry away the auriflambe of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous zeale?

            <p>When by ſucceding turnes the moſt part of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affricke</hi> was corrupted and fallen away, and all Europe conuerted to the ſacred A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall Romane faith: when Monaſteries began in this North Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world to be built, and great multitudes of Monkes, Friers, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons regulars, Nunnes, and other ſacred Saints and holy perſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort themſelues together: when Emperors, Kings, Queenes, Princes, Lords and Ladies of all degrees, fled from their regall Palaces to priuat Cels, and left the triumphes of their conqueſts, the trophees of their loues, and pompes and pleaſures of their Courts, to who ſo would poſſeſſe
<pb facs="tcp:20192:4"/> them: when here an Anchoreſſe, there an Hermit, and in euery wood, wild and deſert, ſome ſacred virgine, valed, inueſted, interred &amp; dead to the world, was to be found: when all fertile ſoyles, all places of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, profite and content, all earthly wealths, and reuenues of moſt woorth, were turned into Abbey and Church lands, liuings and liuely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods: when holy emulation was, who might giue moſt, all gaue of the best, and made this flouriſhing Iſle our Ladies dower: when Kings and Queenes, Prieſts and Prelates, Lords and Ladies, Monkes and Friers, ſacred Virgins and chaſt Matrons, and all ſorts of perſons knew their duties, firſt to God, to his Church, &amp; to her Prieſts: then to their Prince, to the Commonwealth, and to her Peeres: and laſtly each one to another, how, when, and where to commaund or obey: when all things ſorted to ſo ſweet a ſympatheall harmonie in Engliſh hearts, as <hi>England</hi> by a prerogatiue royall of grace diuine, merited to be called <hi>Anglia chara Deo gens:</hi> when flying fame of their rare Angelicall conuerſation had fronted the coaſts of furtheſt countries, and occupied with great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mind the mouthes of moſt men in the world: when <hi>England, Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Flaunders, Italy, Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Germany, Spaine, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Hungary, Sicilie, Naples</hi> and <hi>Cyprus, Denmarke, Poland</hi> and <hi>Sweden, Scotland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> did ſtriue for a ſupremacie to carry away the garland of vertue, deuotion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on all ſides. Then <hi>inimicus homo,</hi> enuying at mans felicitie, to conforme (by permiſsion diuine) Gods concurrence with ſecondarie cauſes, to the Philoſophers preſcript of generation and corruption: in tract of time, corrupting all theſe Northren and Weſterne parts of the world, with contention, ambition, Turciſme, hereſie and Phariſaiſme; a new generation of Catholike truth and religion begins to labour, and bring ſoorth their children amongſt the <hi>Indians, Antipodies,</hi> and new found world, before vnknowne vnto theſe Northren and Weſterne parts: diſcouered firſt by <hi>Portingals</hi> and Friers, and after proceeded in by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Ieſuits. And now liſten what followed.</p>
            <p>Amongst many other cadences and fals, the heauieſt of all the reſt hath bene iudged by many to haue bene our <hi>Engliſh</hi> calamities, begun at firſt by the ambitious aſpires of Cardinall <hi>Wolſey,</hi> who affecting the higheſt Soueraigntie in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall on earth, made a great breach by his contrarie plotting, betwixt King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memorie, and the Sea Apoſtolicke. And afterward, when vnder her Maieſtie, Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our Soueraigne now regnant, ſundrie
<pb facs="tcp:20192:5"/> perſons of rare indowments, graces and abilities, had retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to places of ſtudie and ſeruice of their Lord God beyond the ſeas, where they liued in diuerſe Seminaries and Colledges, leading there a right Monasticall and religious life, in a most perfect ſtate of religious profeſsion, calling and order, (as both all other religious Orders, and Eccleſiaſticall perſons that conuerſed with them, or knew their manner of life, and whereunto their whole ſtudie tended, did acknowledge ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in teares) proceeding after their returne hither, <hi>in ſimplicitate cordis,</hi> with all humilitie, patience, and charitie, abſtracted from all gaule, guile, or ſtate affaires: as men moſt willing to communicate Gods bleſsings and graces to others, fructifying maruellouſly in our countrie by them, and accepting as coadiutors with them in this their haruest on Gods behalfe, all and euery religious perſon of any Order, that would hazard themſelues as they did, had our language, and ſhould come with like Apoſtolicall commiſsion and authoritie wherewith they came: none otherwiſe then as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> our Apoſtle firſt entred this land. Of all the rest of religious Orders, that vndertooke with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries this ſpeciall conflict, the fathers of the ſocietie of <hi>Ieſus</hi> were the most in number: who preſently forgetting the Apoſtolicall worke of Seminarie Prieſts alreadie taken in hand, began foortwith to take a new prepoſterous and neuer heard of Apoſtolicall courſe for conuerſion of countries: to wit, by tampering, temporizing and ſtatizing like marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all men, or common ſouldiers in the field of warre, in all temporall, mundane, and ſtratagemicall affaires.</p>
            <p>The Seminaries innocently iudging the beſt of their bad meanings (as charitie, they thought, did bind them) were willing at the first to colour, hide, and conceale all: making the Ieſuites cauſe, attempts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, practiſes, and proceedings, their owne in euery thing, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them the preheminence, fame, honour and renowne in euery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction acted by them: vntill at laſt they were intangled by penall lawes iustly made againſt them equally, as againſt the Ieſuits: (whoſe plots and practiſes, they ſeemed at firſt to defend, or at leaſt to winke at) and withall perceiued that the Ieſ. religious pietie, being turned into meere ſecular, or rather temporall and laicall pollicie, did occaſionate in them an aſpire to ſoueraigntie: and that taking an elle vpon an inch giuen them, did tempt them with an ambitious hope of domineering ouer them, and thereby ouer the whole Cleargie and ſtate Eccleſiaſticall: hand then the ſaid Prieſts for their owne indempnitie, were driuen to prouide
<pb facs="tcp:20192:5"/> and looke to themſelues. <hi>Et hinc illae lachrymae</hi> of all the euils that ſince haue enſued, aſwell reſpecting the perſecutions inflicted vpon vs all, for their owne peculiar and priuate practiſes, as alſo in regard of the hartburnings and contentions, that ſince haue bene and are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent betwixt them and the Seminarie Prieſts: which heauie accident, and of all other moſt ſtraunge manner of proceeding in the Ieſuits, hath cauſed many to bath their ſighes in bloud, and me to theame my ſpeech in teares, to thinke, how that their inſolencie hath paſt ſo farre beyond the bounds of charity, iuſtice and all humanity, as I muſt be forced to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all the world, what groſſe errors they do maintaine, how maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly the people are blinded, and ſeduced by them: and how dangerous a race they runne to their owne and all others deſtruction, that will be currents of that fatall courſe begun by them, with contempt of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and all Eccleſiaſticall order, with contempt of ſacred Maiestie, and all magiſteriall gouernment, and with moſt turbulent, ſeditious, and trecherous innouations, ſupplantations, defamations, and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of all, that rubbe not on their loftie banke, rebellions and conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies againſt both Pope and Prince, Church, Commonwealth, and all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates therein.</p>
            <p>And becauſe that (as I haue ſhewed) there is nothing permanent or certaine here on earth, ſaue onely the power of Prieſthood, for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of the Sacraments, (that ſentence propheticall ſtanding irrepea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable for euer, <hi>tu es ſacerdos in aeternum ſecundum ordinem Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi>) and that irremoueable ground of truth, graunted only and wholly to the ſame prieſtly power, to remaine without all poſsibilitie of errour in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire to the worlds end: all other foundations, aſſurances, priuiledges and prerogatiues fayling, ſaue this alone: no Monarch in the world being ſure of his eſtate, no religious Order being certaine of their ſtand, nor perſon of most perfection being freed from chance and change, from better to worſe, and to haue a hideous downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall this night before to morrow: hereupon (as in our caſe in hand we haue experience) there riſing many thouſands of abſurdities, whiſpered into gadding heads, and itching eares by ſo many intricate politicall plots and deuiſes, as for to ſet them downe in a poſitiue diſcourſe, Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall ſtile, or hiſtoricall method, were but <hi>oleum &amp; operam perdere:</hi> the ignorant multitude (to whom the matter moſt belongs for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtruction, eſpecially whom the Ieſuits vſe moſt, as women goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, trumpetters of their prayſes) being not poſsibly able to conceiue,
<pb facs="tcp:20192:6"/> much leſſe to carry away ſo many particular points, as are in queſtion betwixt vs and the Ieſuits: and as which (if either they acknowledge an obedience to Gods Church, to the Popes Holineſſe, and to all or anie Prieſt, or a due loyaltie to their Prince and Soueraigne, or a dutifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the common wealth of their natiue land, or any loue or affection to their fleſh, bloud, kindred, friends, and generally to all noble, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and humane <hi>Engliſh</hi> hearts: or laſtly, any care of their owne ſoules, good name and fame before God and man:) they muſt heare of, conceiue of, haue beaten into their heads and hearts, and carry about with them for their better information, reſolution &amp; conceit of things like Catholiks indeed, where euer they go or happen into company, <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientes auribus, &amp; à veritate auditum auertentes:</hi> which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſe amongſt ſilly women, more deuout then diſcreet, as alwayes in extreames, either Saints or Diuels. I haue therefore thought vpon the eaſieſt, readieſt, briefest, plaineſt and exacteſt of any other courſe or methode, that (I thinke) could poſsibly be found out, aſwell to ſatisfie all parties, that deſire to be reſolued of all or any point in queſtion amongst vs: or that will not wilfully and malitiouſly (as God forbid any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or well minded Schiſmaticke ſhould) be caried away with popular applauſe into manifest errours: as alſo to deliuer the truth and ſtate of the matter by ſuch interrogatorie queſtions, Articles or Quodlibets, as ſhall both touch to the quicke, whatſoeuer is offered, propoſed, or comes to be examined, quſtioned withall, or reaſoned vpon amongſt the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or ignorant on any ſide: and yet withall allay the paſsions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie affected Reader, and abate the heate of the haughtie heart in all or any that find themſelues touched or grieued therewith. So as by this kind of Methode, they ſhall haue neither cauſe iuſtly to complaine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie or wrong done or offered vnto them: neither any euaſion or means to eſcape from detecting and making known, what is in their very harts, who are wronged, and who are not, what euery one is bound for his own ſecuritie, to ſpeake, write, beleeue and practiſe in theſe things, and how farre he may go therin. For if that by way of a Quodlibet or Theſis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, a man may without blaſphemie, ſinne, ſcandall, or any offence in the world, aske whether God or the Diuell be to be honoured: whether our Sauiour Chriſt could ſinne or no: whether our bleſſed Lady were an adultreſſe or common woman or not, &amp;c. and withall to bring argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſillogiſticall, enthimematicall and inductiue, or exemplarie <hi>pro &amp; contra</hi> for auerring, and impugning of the ſame: then to put foorth
<pb facs="tcp:20192:6"/> a queſtion, whether a Seminarie Prieſt or a Ieſuite ought ſooner to be credited, eſteemed of, and followed: whether a Ieſuite be a good or a bad man: whether their doctrine be erronious, trecherous and ſeditious or not: whether it be lawfull to call a knaue a knaue, an hereticke an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, a traitor a traitor, a baſtard a baſtard, &amp;c. or not: and how, when, where and vpon what occaſions ſuch queſtions, doubts, and interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories may and ought to be propoſed, and anſwer made <hi>pro &amp; contra</hi> agreeing to humane conceit, morall capacitie, and iuſt cenſure of and in ſuch caſes, cannot iuſtly incurre any reprehenſion or blame. Beſides, this kind of proceeding ſhall (as I haue ſaid) both driue the true conceipt of matters the better into peoples hearts, heads and eares: and yet not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate any by galling words (which poſitiue diſcourſes in accuſations do ordinarily occaſionate, and cannot be auoyded) further then the rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp of truth in things neceſſarie to be knowne, muſt needs ſtirre and moue the guiltie, conſtrained by this meanes to hold vp his hand at barre, and to haue his wounds launced, ſearched and diſcouered to the very naked heart in open ſight.</p>
            <p>This then being the ſumme of what I intend to write and here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to no other end, as I take my ſweet Sauiour and all his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints to witneſſe, then to deliuer the ignorant out of errour: to giue to the terſacred Apoſtolicall Romane Church, faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their due, and to make known what loyaltie, what ſeruice, what deare affection ought to be in euery ſubiect (euen by authoritie of all lawes of God or man) in defence of their Prince, countrie and ſtate where they liue: I will hold the indifferent, diſpaſsionate, and diligent Reader, with no longer diſcourſe of a Preamble: but leauing all to his beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, and deſiring no euill opinion, ſiniſter conſtruction or hard cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to paſſe of my well meant indeuors, I commit his ſharpe wits, or her ſwift thoughts to the ſpeedie encounter of this Bucke of the firſt head in the quest at euery Quodlibeticall relay, ſet in the purſuit of their game.</p>

            <p>FOraſmuch as all theſe 10 Quodlibets conſiſting of 10 Articles a peece, haue a relation to the good or harme done, in and to the Church, common-wealth, the heads of both, and principall members either ſpecificall or indiuiduall in either of them by the Ieſuits fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and confederats, in caſting of plots for their purpoſe and moſt aduantage: aſwell by plauſible perſwaſions in paſſages of ſpeech, as alſo by countermined platformes in practicall conſpiracies, I thought it good to giue you to vnderſtand (as a point of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance neceſſary to be knowne) that all and euery of theſe Quodlibets and Articles, are of ſuch ſpeciall matter, as they are not to be tearmed Metaphiſicall conceits, or coniectured inuentions of ſpeculatiue knowledge, but are in very deed Phiſicall, practicall and knowne things, which riſe in queſtion, and are talked of euery where, of Cleargy and Laity, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and Proteſtants, men and women, nobles and gentiles, boyes and girles, home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne ſubiects, and aliens or ſtrangers: yea, what part of Chriſtendome, nay of the whole Macrocoſme this day, almoſt is free or exempted from the knowledge or hearing of what I meane to diſcuſſe and reaſon of in briefe: no nation vnder the cope of heauen but ſhall find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues touched, and to haue an intereſt, part, and portion in ſome one or other of theſe queſtions quodlibetical, &amp; articles here propoſed. For which cauſe the firſt Quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet offered as an obiect to the eyes of the ignorant, ſeemeth ſitly to be tearmed a Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet of plots by ſcandale and offence taken by ſome Phariſaically or Iewiſhlike, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be regarded: by others ſuperſtitiouſly, or rather too ſcrupulouſly, and therefore neceſſary to be informed of the truth, and reformed of their errour: as being in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſcandale not directly giuen, but onely taken of their infirmity and weake iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and vnderſtanding (for a prudent, wiſe, and ſound Catholike, or other perſon of ſtayd wit, cenſure and conceit, will neuer be ſcandalized at theſe contentions or the like.)

For how is it poſſible otherwiſe that in a caſe ſo manifeſt as this is, ſcil: the Ieſuits write directly infamous libels, againſt both Catholicke Prieſts, and againſt the whole Common-wealth of their natiue land, and againſt all in generall of both ſtates eccleſiaſticall and temporall: and the Seculars write onely Apologies in a iuſt defence of all theſe, this being the caſe on both ſides, how is it poſſible that a halfe witted man (vnleſſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with partiall fauour or feare) ſhould erre ſo groſſely and palpably in the ſight of all the world, as to ſuſpend, excommunicate, &amp;c. or at leaſt make it be giuen out ſo, or winke at the brokers of it, to haue it thought that the Prieſtes bookes may not be read, and yet the Ieſuits bookes may; nay, ſhall be commended vnto both men and women of purpoſe to be read, as moſt excellent, rare and learned matter, ſcil: for to bring their necks into the halter: well if God pardon maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> this fault, there is good hope, he will pardon all his offences; yet is it <hi>vincibilis,</hi> yea and <hi>Craſſa ignorantia,</hi> in the higheſt degree of groſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Maiſter <hi>Blackwels</hi> authoritie is onely (if he haue any, and not loſt all by abuſe of it) in cauſes eccleſiaſticall concerning Religion, &amp;c. and therefore let him looke to the caſe of premunire, for his accepting of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of ſoueraigntie, contrarie to the order preſcribed by the ancient lawes of this kingdome, as ſome do hold, and for his intermedling in allowance of the Ieſuits libels and ſtatizations, and not threaten the ſeculars in that wherein he hath nothing to do.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if his authoritie extended (as it is pretended) to inhibite and forbid all kind of bookes, but ſuch as he ſhould approue, allow and licence: yet in all reaſon it hath this limitation, viz: where he himſelfe is not a partie: or if not ſo, yet in an action of life and death, of ſoule, bodie, honor or good name: he cannot forbid any whoſoeuer to write or ſpeake in defence of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the ſaid liues, and to cleare himſelfe if he can: neither can he yet forbid or forwarne any one to reade or heare any thing that may ſaue the life of the innocent. And therefore the moſt inhumane, vnchriſtian, vncatholicke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt and vncharitable part that euer was heard of, to ſtop or ſeem to ſtop the Prieſts Apologies, written in defence of their good names, taken away by the Ieſuits: an act ſo cruell, vnnaturall, and contrarie to all lawes diuine or humane, as the Popes Holineſſe cannot diſpenſe with any one, to fulfill it,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20192:12"/> no more, then to diſpenſe with any one to kill himſelfe, either bodily or ghoſtly, as the not writing of theſe Apologies, or the like, were (at leaſt) the ſpirituall death of ſundrie reuerend Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is but a meere canuas and cauill of the Ieſuits put into the Archprieſts, or ſome others of their brokers heads, that go about the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, with witleſſe ſcrolles of paper to make them beleeue that it is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; or a great ſinne to reade theſe bookes, and done onely of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not of anie high policie, but of a ſlie Machiuilian deuiſe of the Ieſuits, to keepe the ignorant ſtill in a blind conceit and opinion of their puritanian holineſſe, which theſe bookes would much diſcouer.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, this is one difference betwixt a matter of fact and a matter of faith, that the firſt dependeth vpon reaſoning and diſcourſe, and therefore is it called <hi>Scientia acquiſita,</hi> which by ſome apprehenſion may this day erre, &amp; by ſome other to morrow be rightly informed againe: &amp; the ſecond is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent vpon all humane knowlege, as a meere gift of God infuſed into the ſoule, whereupon that knowledge we haue in matters of faith, takes his name thereof to be called <hi>Scientia infuſa,</hi> which being once inſerted in the ſoule of man by God alone, it may afterwards be helped (for matters of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) by natural wit &amp; reaſon. Therfore is it, that wit &amp; will being ſubiect both to error, the vnlearned are iuſtly and verie neceſſarily forbidden to to reade hereticall bookes; leſt wading aboue their heads, they be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in error: but in a matter of fact, depending wholy vpon humane cauſes, experience and common knowledge, the caſe is quite altered. For that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euerie one is to labour, and ſeeke to be inſtructed and to learne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how in a like caſe thereafter he is to deale: and therefore no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is due for reading of theſe bookes, neither ought any to be debarred from notice taking of them.</p>

                  <p>TO leaue off now and let all lye dead, or as before it was, were an act of iniuſtice, vnlawfull, vncharitable, and preiudiciall to the whole church of God.

Secondly no queſtion there is in it, but that the like contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue bene in Gods church heretofore, and will be to the worlds end: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe could not the church Catholike be called militant here on earth: nor be fitly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to a ſhip toſſed vpon the ſea one while in danger of ſinking, another while of ſplitting, and then again of running vpon ſome rock or on ground, and ſtill interchangeably fleeting betwixt ſtormes and calmes: nor yet parabolized with a net caſt into the ſea, gathering &amp; containing in it all kinds of fiſh and frie: or with new ſowne ſeed, which growing vp, is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with weeds. Thirdly, although it be rather to be accounted of, as a miracle, that all this while there hath not, then to hold it as a ſcandale, that now there hath fallen out ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentions amongſt Gods ſeruants &amp; Prieſts, ſeeing that in heauen (and that in a ſecond inſtant of time, or third of ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall exiſtence) there was high ambition: in paradiſe (and that as ſome lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diuines do hold, within 3. houres ſpace) there was too much curioſitie: in the Apoſtles ſchoole (and that within 3. yeres ſpace) there was too deep emulation, contention, auarice and treaſon wrought againſt the ſupreame Maieſtie. What ſhould I ſay more: if in the Catholike Roman church and Apoſtolicall chaire of <hi>Peter,</hi> there haue bene already 23. ſchiſmes paſt; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though then no wonder to heare &amp; ſee the like contentions to theſe of ours: yet that the firſt brochers of any ſuch, went away ſcotfree, it was neuer yet heard of, without a curſe; as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> as the ſerpent, as Iudas: or elſe that they were the beginners of ſome new hereſie or other in the end: as <hi>Nicholas,</hi> as <hi>Arius,</hi> as <hi>Donatus,</hi> as <hi>Nouatus</hi> (all as rare men, as great ſhew of zeale in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Catholikly bent, and as many deuout graue, and learned men to ſide with them at the firſt, as either Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> or Maiſt. <hi>Blackwel</hi> hath.)

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20192:17"/> them aright: another, that they care not how many ſoules periſh, ſo they may winne their hearts and affections vnto them for the time preſent, either by admiring them for rare prudence, learning and gouernment, or adoring them for peereleſſe pietie, perfection and holineſſe: a third, that in ſtead of meekeneſſe, mercie and compaſſion, which of all other ought to ſhine out moſt clearely in a religious heart, theſe men haue put on a ſterne, harſh and cruell hardneſſe, void of all pittie, mildneſſe, or remorſe (ſaue onely Cateo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linian carrying their countenance in their hands, to ſob and ſmile in a trice) and ſo care not what miſerie, affliction or perſecution fall vpon poore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Catholikes in theſe heauie times of our common ſadneſſe: whileſt they liue ſecure who are the chiefe workers of our generall inceſtant cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, by their figure-flingings, plot-caſtings, and libellings againſt their natiue countrie, and preſent ſtate of Engliſh gouernment in other countries. And the fourth and laſt is, their miſchieuous, bloudie, and vnnaturall practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: in that it is apparant, that the onely cauſe why they wiſh perſecution of their poore afflicted country-men, and brethren to continue, and no relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaue, or libertie to be graunted them, is of purpoſe to make our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, her honorable Councell and Peeres of the preſent State, ſeeme more odious, tyrannicall, and hatefull to all Chriſtian nations: and thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to publiſh libels and other ſeditious pamphlets of conſpiracies for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and inuaſions.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention amongſt the Apoſtles, when they ſtroue together for a ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, euen in our Sauiour Chriſt his preſence. So was it in the time of the Arrian hereſie, when the whole Church and chiefe prelates ſeemed to be at daggers drawing, with infamous libels put vp by Biſhops againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts againſt Prieſts, &amp; one religious againſt another, before that pious Emperor of all worthie memorie, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great: and ſo hath it euer bene, &amp; no doubt but now ſo it will be, God ſweetly ſo diſpoſing. Secondly, of all Axiomes in Philoſophie, this is holden for one of the trueſt, moſt certaine, and infallible rule, that <hi>nullum violentum eſt perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> VVherupon Chriſtian Philoſophers haue defined, that though there were no Scripture, nor Catholike church authoritie to confirme it: yet by this phiſical poſition of cauſes, it is not poſſible but the world ſhold make an end, and a ſtay made of the planets courſe and heauens motion, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that <hi>primum mobile,</hi> in a tergiuerſed violence of oppoſite race to the reſt, runs a courſe againſt the haire And of like ſort by an argument of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, <hi>vel ab exemplo, vel à comparatione,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that it is impoſſible for the Ieſuits to hold out long, running a moſt violent courſe in oppoſition againſt the whole Church of God, and all the 3. eſtates ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, temporall, and Monaſticall: as will appeare at large by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of particulars of their ſeditious and wrangling diſpoſition, faction, and oppoſition againſt Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, and other prelates and prieſts in the ſtate eccleſiaſticall: againſt Kings, Princes, Peeres, Nobles, Gentles, and all ſorts of ciuill Magiſtrates in the State temporall; againſt Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s regular, Monks, Friers, &amp; all other religious orders in the ſtate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical that haue any liuelyhoods, which they want: for as a Capouchine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20192:18"/> once ſaid, his order liued quieteſt of any other with the Ieſuits, becauſe the Ieſuits would willingly haue all, and the Capouchines would willingly haue nothing, but euen to keepe ſoule and life together. Thirdly, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt impoſed a neceſſitie to the coming of hereſies: he meant not onely to the end that hypocrites might thereby be deciphered, and lewde ſeducers of others made knowne to the world (for he knew them full well himſelfe long beforehand,) but withall that thereby his ſpouſe might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more beautifull, ſweet, amiable and glorious. For ſeeing none can be called properly an hereticke, but ſuch as firſt haue bene catholike, either by birth of baptiſme, or after conuerſion and education: and none ſuch draw any multitudes after their fall vnto them, vnleſſe during the time of their ſtand &amp; abode in Gods church, they had gotten by a counterfeited holines an admiration of inconſtant people to be had of them. Therefore to the end that thoſe, who by their corrupt life and manners in the Church, would not onely damne themſelues, but alſo draw many thouſands by their externall ſhewes and pretences of pietie to hell with them, ſhould be ſtopped and preuented of their wretched courſe, it hath euer pleaſed the Diuine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whoſe prouidence is neuer enough to be admired at, nor his iuſtice trembled at, nor his mercies magnified: to let be caſt a ſtumbling blocke in the way of reprobates, whereby they might take an occaſion to leape out of Gods church: &amp; thereupon God ſhew his iuſt iudgements vpon them, and all that leape out with them, and his mercies vpon the remainder; that after their impietie diſcouered would no longer be ſeduced by them. And ſo in the riſe and fal of euery one, God is alwaies honored, his church glorified, and all Catholikes hearts greatly comforted and benefited.</p>
                  <p>Were it not the feare I haue to be too tedious, I might here enlarge my ſelfe with a long diſcourſe of all the principall hereſies and Archheretickes that euer haue bene. For had not <hi>Arius</hi> many worthy prelates all ſound Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes at the firſt to take his part? So had <hi>Donatus,</hi> ſo had <hi>Nouatus,</hi> ſo had <hi>Eutiches,</hi> ſo had <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> ſo had many hundreds of Arch-heretickes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as he: yea and ſuch ſtood on their ſide, as before euer the contention was decided, had glorified heauen with Saints, &amp; beautified the earth with Martyrs reliques. And yet we ſee it was neither an argument of their pietie, becauſe ſo many holy <hi>Ciprians</hi> and other bleſſed men and women, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on their ſide at the firſt: neither yet a confirmation of their error at the laſt, becauſe one and he a Prieſt was of power to vexe, trouble, and torment the whole church of Affrick, and another the Catholike church of Aſia in his abortiue Primitiues, &amp; after the whole chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> world infected with his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, in many millions of his followers.

                  <p>This being their whole ſtudy and care (ah here how can the ſorrowfull ſequels be remembred without Apoſtrophees of inconſolable griefes) that now (poore wormes) they ſhould be troden vnder foote in their owne corne-fields, in the heate of their harueſt, and euen by thoſe that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be their coadiutors, and fellow-laborers: and that in their owne natiue countrey, hauing no other place certaine to relye vpon: whereas the Ieſuits haue their peculiar houſes and Colledges in euery kingdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt throughout the world?

Thirdly, the Puritanes are entred into ſecret league of conſpiracy, againſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profeſſors of the Goſpell: and ſo are the Ieſuits againſt all other profeſſors of the Romane faith. Fourthly, the Puritanes call themſelues the ſainctly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, deuided from all others, that are not of their ſect and opinion: and the Ieſuits call themſelues the holy diuiſion ſeparated from all other, that are not of their faction.

Fourteenthly, the Puritanes will haue no ſuperiours: no more will the Ieſuites. Fifteenthly, the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes will acknowledge no obedience to any Eccleſiaſticall dignitie: no more will the Ieſuites, but yet both of them counterfeitly and diſſemblingly do yeeld. Sixteenthly, the Puritanes labour to pull all Biſhops downe, and to haue none but Superintendents in England, and haue made hauocke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie of all ſuch in Scotland: and the Ieſuites will let no Biſhop be in either Realme, if they can keepe them from that ſuperioritie ouer them. Seuenteenthly, the Puritanes ſeeke to pull downe Kings and Princes: and ſo do the Ieſuites. Eighteenthly, the Puritanes would bring all Kings and common-wealthes to a popularitie and Oligarchicall gouernement: and ſo would the Ieſuites. Nineteenthly, the Puritanes controull both Princes and Prelates, as if they were their ſuperiours: and the Ieſuites checke and controule both Pope and Prince, as at leaſt their equals. Twentiethly, the Puritane Miniſters muſt be of counſell with the Prince, in the higheſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of his Realme: &amp; ſo muſt the Ieſuiticall padres, or elſe all is out of frame.

Two and twentiethly, the Puritanes muſt haue the peruſing, ratifying and confirming, of whatſoeuer doth paſſe from the Prince or Lords, ſpirituall or temporall of the land: and ſo muſt the Ieſuites, or elſe it ſhall be deſpiſed, reiected, and holden for ridiculous, and not worth the ſetting foorth or publiſhing. Three and twentiethly, the Puritanes must haue all Princes, Nobles or other ſtates ſo dutifull and ſeruiceable vnto them, as they must not laugh, they must not play, they muſt not walke, they muſt not talke, they muſt not giue or receiue any gifts, or vſe any priuate conference, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent recreation, &amp;c. without their conſent or priuitie: and onely ſo much and no more, then they appoint them: and euen iuſt ſo is it with the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.

But we ſee that is falſe: for ſome nations haue one kind of gouernement and manner of ſucceſſion: and ſome another, &amp;c. ergo</hi> gouernement and ſucceſſion by birth and bloud, are not of the law of God and nature.</p>
                  <p>This Elenchiall fallacy (for he will not dare ſtand ſyncategoremati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to approue it) denies ſlatly free-will, putting no difference betwixt the law of God and nature in man, and the ſame law in bruite beaſtes: whereas there is not a boy of any wit, that rightly vnderſtands onely Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiries predicables but wold hiſſe him out of the ſchooles, for a fond wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling and vnlearned Sophiſter, to confound natures freedome, in her ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall brood, differenced by reaſon and ſenſe (and ſo leaue quite out the third <hi>vniuerſale</hi>) as <hi>rationale</hi> and <hi>irrationale:</hi> or thus, naturall reaſon and naturall ſenſe: the former being naturally as free to change, as the latter is naturally bound to his obiect.

                  <p>But for this and other ſome halfe ſcore of groſſe errours like vnto it you ſhall ſee (I hope) ſufficient matter in confutation of things in the Antiperiſtaſis to the firſt part of <hi>Parſons Doleman,</hi> concerning his many many groſſe abuſes of both Canon, Ciuill, and common lawes, decrees and cuſtomes.</p>
                  <p>Another principle or propoſicion of a Ieſuit concerning their falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contrary to the beleefe of the Romane Catholike Church is, that the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20192:21"/> ſtewes are in Rome <hi>cum approbatione</hi> as lawfull as any Citizen, Magiſtrate or order of religion, or yet the Pope himſelfe. Another like hereticall, and moſt dangerous aſſertion of theirs is, that the auncient fathers <hi>rem tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiationis ne attigerunt.</hi> A like to this is their ſcoffe and ieſt at Prieſthood affirming it to be but a toy, that a Prieſt is made by tradition of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, patten, and oaſt into his hands, &amp;c. And a not much vnlike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Prieſthood is collected out of the three farewels of the ſoule, made ſimply God-wot by a wiſeman, and yet commended to the skies by the Ieſuits and their faction: becauſe forſooth if that abſurd booke might haue taken place none ſhould haue had any ghoſtly father but a Ieſuite, or ſome ſubſtitute Prieſt vnder him.</p>
                  <p>Yea the Author of that falſe doctrine and moſt arrogant hypocriticall or Phariſaicall errour, being friendly admoniſhed in a letter from a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prieſt to be warie of his writings, and not to be ſo lauiſh of his pen, nor raſh with his tongue as he had bene, reſcribing backe in a moſt ſaucie and peremptorie manner, taking it in ſcorne to receiue any charitable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition (much leſſe ſuch correction as he had iuſtly deſerued) at anie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſtes hands, was groſly bold to tell him, amongſt other things, that whereas he acknowledged a dutie, and reſpect to be had to religeous Prieſtes (meaning Ieſuits, as the tenor of his letter imports) yet to him he acknowledged none, be being but a ſecular Prieſt, and himſelfe a ſecular gentleman: and no difference vnleſſe it were in this that he might miniſter the Sacraments to him, which he could not, &amp;c. A like to theſe is there no leſſe abſurd then erronious doctrine concerning their Generals in fallability of truth for deciding of matters, their abſurd paradoxes of equiuocation, malepert, bold, and damnable doctrine in preiudice of the Sea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, ſecretly laboring to infringe the appeale, admitting a company of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly women to be the Archprieſts and Ieſuites graue Counſellors (an odde conceit fit to haue bene laughed at by the Romane Senate whiles gentiliſme there ruled: When the wily wagge told his curious mother the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were conſulting about pluralitie of wiues, &amp;c.) Well, yet our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh goſſippes thus fawned vppon by theſe ſeducing guides, and thereby poore ſoules made fond of them, muſt be ſet on with a companie of greene heades God wot, and ſome but baſe fellowes (for ſo their baſe conditions, and vnhoneſt dealing makes them, where otherwiſe being ſome of them gentles of auncient hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet deſerue to haue their armes reuerſed, and their coates pulled ouer their eares, for ſpeaking or officiouſly intruding them ſelues for bribes and gaine to bee brokers of theſe ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ieſuites errours againſt their owne conſciences, to conicatch thoſe as ignorant as themſelues, and to worke as much as in them lyes, to make all Catholikes abhorre, contemne, and loath both Prieſtes and all, or any of the ſeculars that are in the appeale, yea, which is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20192:22"/> moſt odious and ſeditious: they maintaine a popularitie to ſet all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects on againſt their Princes, as hereafter ſhall be touched at large. Which with many the like, if they ſhould maintaine in any Catholike countrey they would be burnt at a ſtake for it, as abſurd heretikes one after another.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be too long perforce: but for the reſt I referre the reader to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry bookes ſet out,, and to be publiſhed againſt them.

                  <p>THere haue ſundrie of them apoſtataed &amp; fallen out of Gods Church, without euer returne or reformation, or recouery, and thereupon haue they and other Ieſuits that remained as then in the Church written moſt bitterly one againſt the other, ſome of whoſe hereticall bookes my ſelfe haue ſeene in print. But for thoſe that ſeduce the Engliſh Catholikes, of whom now principally theſe Quodlibets do intreate, they neither can, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may iuſtly be called heretikes, becauſe they do not ſtand obſtinate in their opinion of any of theſe things: neither do they, neither dare they maintaine anie of theſe hereſies or errours as yet, whatſoeuer they intend hereafter, when they ſee an end of the appeale, and who will ſtand to them and who forſake them: but all in ſuch ſlye diſſembling equiuocate and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert ſort, as hard it ſhall be to faſten any error vpon them. For their plots by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20192:22"/> doctrine like as by al other proiects, tending rather in deed to flat atheiſme, then to any particular hereſie, they were vnworthy the name of temporiſed ſtatiſts (wherof they boaſt) or to be readers in <hi>Machiuels</hi> ſchoole (which is their ſecret practiſe in ſcholeriſme:) if they ſhould not denie all and change their opinions, agreeing to time, perſon and place: and as a Counſellor at the common law once ſaid (rather truſting God with their ſoules, then the world with their bodies) he would neither burne for the one nor hang for the other.

                  <p>O huge, monſtrous, audacious, nay officious intruding boldneſſe, did you euer heare the like cogging mate, who to bleare the peoples eies and to band and bolſter out ſo horrible a fact, as to thruſt a Ieſuit Archprieſt vpon vs, and that moſt tyrannically to be <hi>flagellum Dei</hi> ouer the ſecular Prieſts ſpite of their teeth, he would make men beleeue, nay women in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; (for the moſt part of their pure ſpirits are of the female ſexe as eaſieſt deluded) that he tooke vpon him the defence of the Sea Apoſtolike in managing with huffe and ruffe this foiſted in authoritie. Well yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame his wit (though I deteſt his hypocriſie in this action, as an acte

                  <p>But of this matter I ſhall haue occaſion to talke hereafter: onely thus much I haue here noted to giue the diligent Reader to vnderſtand what notable deuiſes theſe men haue to ſeduce the ignorant and well meaning hearts: how rightly they tread the pathes of al former hereticks at their firſt entrance into the blind by waies of ſingularitie, which brought them quite out of the Kings path, high way, or Watling ſtreet: how plaine their abſurd, groſſe, and manifeſt errours do appeare, though it be impoſſible (by reaſon of their diſſimulation, equiuocation, ſophiſtication, winding, twinding and doubling (to faſten any hereſie vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they wil haue ſuch interpretations, expoſitions, comments and gloſſes, or rather gloſes, and how notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they may not be iuſtly termed hereticks, becauſe neither is their perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie in generall yet knowne, neither anie one mans particular obſtinacie made (as yet) manifeſt in the premiſes.

And how ſharp, bitter, and extreame ſoeuer, or exorbitant (as ſome of them terme my letters) I may ſeeme in ſpeech or writing againſt them, for coraſiues (not lenitiues) muſt helpe or nothing in the deepe launcing of theſe inward feſtred ſores, couered ouer with ſound fleſh and skin to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, yet God is my witnes, I do as affectionatly &amp; tenderly, as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and vnfainedly wiſh their amendment euen from my verie heart, and in my poore prayers do as daily remember euerie day vpon my knees, &amp; at Gods holy altar in time of my beſt memories and deuotion: yea and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, do recommend their and our vnitie, peace and quiet together, (as Catholickes, both prieſtes and lay perſons ſhould haue and liue in) to euerie penitent that comes vnto me vnder <hi>benedicite,</hi> as duely and

                  <p>To name anie in particular ſeduced by them I am verie loath, for that they are all or moſt part of them of one of theſe three ſorts, and therefore may probably be reclaimed: to wit, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are led away of meere ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie &amp; indiſcreet zeale, whoſe wits be on the one ſide inſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne by outward actions what is in the inward ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is a hard matter for anie to define of: and on the other ſide, as inſufficient to be practitioners for theſe ſtateſmen in regard of the ſame defect: and therefore are made onely Parrots, Pies, or iangling Iayes, to prattle vp and downe all that they heare and ſee: where you muſt note, that all which they ſhall heare or ſee, muſt be onely of ſuch things as may ſtirre them vp with zeale, (forſooth) and as an act of ſpirituall merit to defend theſe holy Fathers in euerie thing, and to be readie to ſpit in a Prieſts face, to flie from him as from a vowed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of Gods Church, becauſe an aduerſarie to the Fatthers, and thinke it to be as horrible a ſinne againſt their conſcience to make as great a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to come to anie Sacrament or ſeruice with them or to aske them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as if they were Ethnickes, Infidels, or other damned creatures, and alreadie denounced to be ſo. But for anie other ſecret or point of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they ſeldome or neuer impart it to theſe tittle tatlers, whereof I could name you beſides ſimple men a whole browne dozen of ſilly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen about London, that courſe both water and land, Citie and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes, houſe and fieldes, with theſe and the like ſpeeches, ſcil.

Others are wholy depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on them for their temporall neceſſities and bodily reliefe: and as the common ſaying is, neede makes men of occupation, and the Ieſuites hauing gotten <hi>Iudas</hi> his office (ſcil to carrie the mony bag) into their ſubſtitutes hands, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of all the wealth and charitie of Catholickes (conſiſting of manie thouſand pounds) where, how, and to whom they pleaſe, though moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, irreligiouſly and abuſiuely they conuert theſe <hi>Pios vſus,</hi> intended by the

Now what would you haue thoſe diſtreſſed Catholikes to do, that liue in want, either by reaſon that their liuings are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them, or vpon ſome other accident of fortunes frowne? the ſecular Prieſts are not able to help them, becauſe they receiue not (moſt of them) one farthing of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contribution, but liue only vpon relief ſent them from their priuat friends: to get a dodkin of a Ieſuit or his procurator it is impoſſible, vnles they wil run with open mouth in defamation of ſeminary Prieſts &amp; their very firſt ſpirituall fathers oftentimes that begot them in Chriſt Ieſus to Godward: and to ſtarue or famiſh they may not, if poſſibly they can auoide it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt this neceſſarie relation needes be betwixt the Ieſuites and theſe kind of proctors, that if the Ieſuits take away their vpper lip, they ſpill their whiſtling: and if they whiſtle not apace againſt all the ſecular Prieſts, with panigeries ſounded out of the Ieſuits praiſes: then ſhall they looſe their vpper lippe, and all their hope of reliefe. And thus are theſe needie perſons made another kind of ſticklers for them, who according to their qualities and abilities to do them ſeruice with a cleanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance in their actions, ſhall be more or leſſe acquainted with ſome of their ſecrets, driftes and markes they ſhoote at.

And though many of them be not God wot of the wiſeſt (for if they were they would neuer be led into a fooles paradiſe, vpon Moone ſhine, hopes of <hi>Lucean</hi> towers to be built for them by theſe great Statiſtes:) yet by reaſon, partly of the great hope (as I ſaid before) of receiuing euer an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for one: and partly of ſome great enemies they haue in oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelues they do runne the courſe of the Ieſuits. In deciding of the controuerſie betwixt the two great houſes of <hi>Arundel</hi> &amp; <hi>Dacre,</hi> I haue made this point more apparant, how the one houſe, that it might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuppreſſe the other, applaudeth to all the Ieſuits vndertake, in hope to be ſtrengthened by them herafter, whilſt the Ieſuits in the meane time like greedy caterpillers do pray vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, &amp; except it be with the flap of a fox tail, ſhal neuer be able to do them any ſeruice.

Of all which with other practiſes in the North, as the ſecret confederacy made by that faction againſt his honor, I had intended to haue informed his Lordſhip, if the foreſaid partie had not diſcloſed a letter which I ſent to inſinuate as much vnto him, and to giue him a caueat, &amp;c. I will ſay no more here, but that this third kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſorts or factious heads ſet on by the Ieſuits againſt the ſecular Prieſtes, are of the proud, ambitious and aſpiring minds, that hoping to clime high when theſe Realmes of <hi>England, Wales</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhal be all one Monarchiall Ile of Ieſuits, they are not much to be blamed if they pleade their cauſe and proſecute their quarrell with tooth &amp; naile.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee that there muſt needes be many ſeduced by them, and eſpecially deuout women (poore ſoules) who mightily dote and runne riot after them. Now what kind of people they are that liue ſo, and by what art and meanes theſe ſeditious plot-caſters do worke it, you ſhall in the end find to your griefe. In the meane while I muſt tell you this withal, that of the more graue, wiſe, and truly more ancient Catholickes and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſort of both cleargie and laitie, men and women, they looſe daily more and more: as by their owne confeſſion the caſe is manfeſt and cleare. For whereas they ſayd about a three yeares agone, that there were but three or foure of the factious Prieſtes (ſo like lozels this Ieſuiticall faction termed the ſecular Cleargie) they now acknowledge and cannot denie it (becauſe the names of ſo many are in printed bookes for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale) that there are thirtie, and yet we wil find twiſe thirtie moe. And for three or foure noble men and gentlemen of the laitie on our ſide (as then they ſayd we had no moe: and thoſe but of green heads and ſhallow wits God wot) we will account vnto them ſo many ſcores. And the like is for women, which daily alſo increaſe of the better, and grauer ſort, more

But becauſe the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of honour are deriued from God to man by participation of the diuine attributes, whereof mercy and iuſtice being the chiefe, the former applied to Chriſt his eternall Prieſthood, the latter to his Regall power: therefore is it, that if a Ieſuit or any other perſon had as neare, great, extraordinary, and often inward ſpeech, conference and familiarity with God, as euer had the <hi>Seraphicall Francis</hi> a more bleſſed Saint, and in a higher place in heauen, as I verily beleeue, then any Ieſuit is as yet, or like to be hereafter, or as had bleſſed Saint <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> or Saint <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Sene,</hi> or ſundry other bleſſed Saints: yet were he neuer to be compared with the meaneſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Prieſt that liues on earth: If he go to compariſons of nearneſſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with God, perfection of ſtate, honour, eſteeme and regard to be had of the perſon, and the like arrogant ſpeeches which the Ieſuits vſe in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating that vnto them, which none that loues them but will bluſh to thinke of their extreame pride and vaine glory groſly ſhewed therein.</p>
                  <p>Here I will tell you of one thing which I haue obſerued, and often no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, eſpecially ſince theſe broiles bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be hote betwixt the ſecular Prieſts and the Ieſuits. Hauing conuerſed and at ſundry times bene in company with diuerſe ſorts of people, of Nobles, Gentles, and other meaner perſons, I neuer yet (to ſpeake in generall termes) came in any place, but the more honorable or generous bloud the party, Lord or Lady, maiſter or miſtreſſe was (and that whether Catholike, Schiſmatike or Proteſtant, though in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner and reſpect had in them) the more reuerent regard had they alwayes of Prieſts, and vſed them with more peculiar eſteeme. And againe, the baſer, meaner, more rude, vnciuill, and low birth the parties were of, the leſſe reſpect they had to any Prieſt, Cleargy, ſcholler, or other perſon o

And further, accompany <hi>Martha</hi> rather then <hi>Mary</hi> in all things which are meere temporall.

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>THE ANSWERE.</head>
                  <p>THeir profeſſion is moſt imperfect, their life is moſt popular, and their ſtate moſt vnſecure, and dangerous of any others in all the world this day, as now they vſe it. And to ſpeake of perfection when it was at the beſt, and therefore at higheſt rate amongſt them, wherein ſhould their perfection conſiſt, that it ſhould be ſo farre and high in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, aboue the ſame kind of perfection <hi>(vtcunque)</hi> in other religeous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Firſt, they do not keepe their houres, in <hi>vigilijs multis,</hi> riſing either at midnight, cocke-crow, or other extraordinarie times, as all other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous perſons do. Secondly, they do not keepe foure, nor two, nor one Lent in the yeare (much leſſe do they faſt the whole yeare through, or all their whole life time, as ſundry do, ſome more, ſome leſſe, in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeous orders) nor vſe any other kind of faſt, or abſtinence more then other ſecular Prieſtes, yea and all the whole Catholike laity do. Thirdly, they do not continually weare haire-cloth, go bare-footed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine the vſe of any linnen and ſoft bed: as many religeous, yea, almoſt all do moſt of theſe things. Fourthly, they neuer vſe any contemptible apparell, or other meanes to occaſionate a contempt to be had of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their owne naked hearts: more then any other Eccleſiaſticall or temporall perſon doth. Fiftly, they imbrace no pouertie more then any, and not ſo much as many religeous orders do: For who hath halfe that wealth that the Ieſuites haue, which they will get by hooke or by crooke, one way or other: as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed. Sixtly, they are not confined to their Cels, Cloiſters, or Colledges. For they will be ſtarke madde to haue their houſes ſtaind with the name of Monaſticall places, as other religious orders are: but haue ſcope to go and liue where and how they liſt, as much as ſtudents haue in any Vniuerſitie in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, and farre more then they will allow to the poore priſoners at
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20192:33"/> 
                     <hi>Wiſhich,</hi> or to ſtudents at home, or other places where the Seminary, and ſecular Prieſtes liue vnder them, and therefore rightly called their priſoners, as kept ſo ſtreightly that they may not recreate themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nor two of them haue any ſpeech or conference without a third, with many like Turkiſh cruelties, which theſe tyrants vſe againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Prieſtes, whileſt they liue in all iollitie, wealth and pleaſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues there: as in all other bookes and Apologies you may find ſet out at large of that matter. Seuenthly, they profeſſe no continuall ſilence nor ſolitarie life, as ſundrie religeous do, and keepe it moſt ſtrictly: thinking it a death to come foorth of their Cels, and Cloiſters, into the world to haue any ſpeech, medling or ſight of any worldly thing. But they quite contrarie profeſſe ſuch a popularity, ſecularitie, temporalitie, and all mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane kind of life and medling in worldly affaires, as wonder it is how euer they haue time to thinke of God or any good Saint. Eightly, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe neither chaſtitie nor yet obedience, more then any other religious order doth: yea no more in very deed (their manner of performing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their ſuperiour conſidered) then euery ſecular Prieſt doth. And if a man go to the wayes and meanes of performance of this their vowe of chaſtitie and obedience, it is farre inferiour and more imperfect, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and dangerous in them, then in any or the moſt part of other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious orders. Ninthly, if their perfection conſiſt in this: that they labour in preaching, teaching, conuerſion of ſoules, miniſtring of Sacraments, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of cauſes, with Princes and ciuill perſons, and therefore as diuines ſay <hi>(quia maius eſt illuminare quam illuminari:)</hi> ſo they affirme that they haue taken a ſtate of moſt perfection that way vpon them (and indeed they take ſo much vpon them in that behalfe, as they ſeeme to arrogate an Apoſtolicall power and authoritie reſerued to themſelues alone, therein ſpeaking it in plaine tearmes, that the ſeculars ought not to meddle in ſuch affaires, but content themſelues like ſillie ſimple men, with hearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions at moſt, or onely ſaying of Maſſe, for as for confeſſions I wis they will not with their good-wils permit that a ſecular Prieſt ſhould take the confeſſions of any: vnleſſe it be of meane perſons and poore folkes, where no gaine nor commoditie is to be had but at Gods hand onely: yet by theſe worſhipfull Rabbies leaues, if they vſurpe ſecular Prieſts places and authority, and thereupon challenge a degree of perfection vnto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and aboue all other, then would I know from whence they haue that gift to illuminate, and power and authority of preaching, teaching, hearing confeſſions, and other like Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdictions.</p>
                  <p>For as for their managing of Ciuill and Martiall cauſes, as inuaſion of kingdomes, raiſing of rebellions, defamation of Princes, and bringing all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a popular contempt, that are not themſelues or dependent on them, and the like abſurd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20192:34"/> as ſuggeſted by him, and after bred in their itching, ambicious idle working braines, ſo no ſecular will wiſh, ſeeke, or accept of that their ſeditious tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and bloudy office (vnfit of all other for Prieſts to deale in) out of their hands. It is therefore of the former Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdictions &amp; lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, whereof I ſpeake, &amp; would know from whence &amp; of whom they haue them. Either they muſt haue them immediatly from God, or elſe from man.</p>
                  <p>To ſay they haue them immediatly from God, I thinke they will not: but yet if they dare ſay ſo (as who can tel what giddy heads puffed vp with ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pride, impudency &amp; inſolency wil ſay or do, when it ſtands the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon to ſtand to their tacklings, or elſe haue all their followers &amp; diſciples forſake them:) then firſt it wil be demanded <hi>per qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regulam</hi> do they proue it? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what teſtimony or witneſſe haue they for it? Thirdly, how, when &amp; in what place was this new inſtitution of Eccleſiaſtiques promiſe granted, confirmed &amp; ratified? Fourthly, by what ſigne, toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wonder or miracle ſhal we know it is from God immediatly: for miracles we muſt haue, for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of all new doctrine &amp; approbation of ancient Catholike traditions, cuſtomes &amp; orders? Thirdly, what manner of man, <hi>vbi gentium,</hi> where was he borne, whoſe ſonne was he, where and how was he brought vp, how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he, how died he, that was the firſt author or illuminate of this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and change? Sixtly and laſt of all, after all theſe things are examined and knowne, and that with helpe of an <hi>Aeſopian</hi> fable, they can bring vs into a conceit of a <hi>Lucean</hi> Tower to be firmely built in the imaginatiue horeſcope of their wandring zodiacke: yet will they all be proued by this meanes to be flat forerunners of Antichriſt, and Archinuenters of new Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiniſme, worſe then euer yet was heard of: or elſe made to do publike pennance throughout all Churches in Chriſtendome, confeſſing before the whole world (as I pray God graunt them grace, humility and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to do it) what blind guides and ſeducers of innocent hearts, they haue bene: leading many ſoules into eminent danger of perdition, by arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating to to much vnto themſelues, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Againe if they ſay they haue this authority, and by conſequent are in ſtate of perfection aboue the ſeculars by inſtitution and gift of and from the Pope his Holineſſe and Sea Apoſtolike: then it will be replied by neceſſary ſequele vpon them. Firſt, that the Pope himſelfe muſt needes be thereby of a more perfect life then they are, which in no wiſe they will yeeld vnto: yea arrogating an extraordinarie familiaritie with God, to be due to them alone, and a kind of impoſſibilitie of errour in their Synodall conſultations, called vnder and by their Generall: their ſpeciall prerogatiue and meanes to bring any one to perfection (they are ſo farre from yeelding or granting it, at leaſt equally with them) to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is ſuch, as they haue preached openly in <hi>Spaine</hi> againſt Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:20192:34"/> the laſt of all holy memorie, and rayling againſt him as againſt a moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man and monſter on earth: they haue called him a Lutheran here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, they haue termed him a wolfe, they haue ſaid he had vndone all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom if he had liued: and in few, Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, as Iudge <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> being asked what he thought of his death, anſwered: <hi>Qui ſine paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia viuit &amp; ſine paenitentia moritur, proculdubio ad infernum deſcendit:</hi> and to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctor of our nation, he ſaid: <hi>Conceptis verbis, quantum capio, quantum ſapio, quantum intelligo deſcendit ad infernum.</hi> Well let this paſſe as a comfort to ſeculars to be ful of imperfections, &amp; as vnworthie creatures to be iuſtly cenſured of by theſe worthie perfectiues, that dare iudge their chief Paſtor: which no ſacred Sinode, nor OEcumenicall Councell, either wold, either durſt euer haue done ſo before them. Secondly, if theſe new illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates take their perfection from this principle, <hi>Quia maius eſt illuminare qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> illuminari,</hi> then muſt they by neceſſarie ſequele herein, alſo be pleaſed to heare it, that <hi>maius eſt dare quàm accipere:</hi> and therefore if the State Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall &amp; ſecular Cleargie giue them this authoritie, wherby they come to this peereleſſe perfection <hi>à fortiori:</hi> yet ſtil the ſecular Prelats as the giuers thereof, muſt be before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that degree of perfection. Thirdly, in order of perfections, this hath euer bene an auncient Canonicall obſeruation and rule of none denied: that any religious perſon may paſſe into an other order of religion, that is ſtricter then his owne is, whereunto he hath vowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, at the firſt intending therein to liue and dye; and all this in regard that the ſaid ſtricter order is holden to be a ſtate of more perfection, and nearer familiaritie or intercourſe with God and his holy Angels, and Saints. But now admit the Ieſuites order, or rather ſocietie (for they are ſuch ſtraunge men, as all muſt conſiſt of innouations, nouelties, and new names amongſt them) were ſo ſtrict, as in regard of this point of perfection, none might paſſe out of their ſocietie into any other religious order: yet as out of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religious orders, there haue paſſed ſome in all ages to take ſecular charge, <hi>&amp; curam animarum</hi> vpon them, ſo alſo out of the Ieſuites ſocietie, there haue paſſed diuers that haue bene Cardinals, &amp;c. And if they denye Cardinals to be ſeculars, or to take charge of ſoules vpon them: once I am ſure they are not Monaſticall, and by conſequent, the farther ſecluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeculars or eccleſiaſtiques, the more temporall and laicall muſt needes their liues be. But yet ſeeing all this notwithſtanding they may come out of the ſocietie to be Cardinals, and then <hi>à fortiori</hi> to be Biſhops, or other Prelats and Paſtors more directly taking <hi>curam animarum</hi> vpon them, it followeth that alwaies their ſtate of perfection is inferior to the ſecular. Fourthly, that thing wherein the merit is either counted greater in ſeeking for it, or in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of it being offered, or the ſinne greater in neglecting to take it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall being commaunded; is euer of more perfection then any other wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe circumſtances. But as no man is bound, neither may he leaue his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20192:35"/> Biſhopricke, or other paſtorall office void without diſpenſation of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. So on the contrarie, any religious perſon, Ieſuit or other may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, yea and oftentimes is bound to leaue his Cell, Cloyſter, or Colledge, (though by his departure the doores muſt, and may be ſhut vp for any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming there euer after) and take <hi>curam animarum</hi> vpon him, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tpote quia is qui epiſcopatum deſiderat bonum opus deſiderat, &amp;c. Et bonum (vt ſupra dixi) quo communis eo melius.</hi> Therefore ſtill is a ſecular life of more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then a religious, by that principle of illuminating others. Fiftly, if they vrge their perfection of life, by illuminating of ſoules to conſiſt of this: that it is done vnder obedience to their ſuperior: which vertue of obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in holy Scripture prophetically defined, to be better then ſacrifice; it followeth that of all other ſignes of perfection, Chriſtian renuntiation, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and denying of themſelues, this is the greateſt, moſt manifeſt and chiefe: in that by reaſon hereof, be they neuer ſo well ſetled to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, wiſh and deſire, hauing all things that may pleaſe or delight them, and freed, preſerued and defended from all things that may moleſt them: yet muſt they keepe ſuch a ſtrait hand, and ſtrait watch ouer their will and all their ſenſes continually, as <hi>volens nolens</hi> their will muſt not be theirs, but their ſuperiors, to go or runne thence in change of a thought, or turne of a hand, and repaire out of <hi>England,</hi> or other Northerne region into <hi>Ethiope, Egypt</hi> or <hi>India:</hi> or elſe whereſoeuer they ſhall be commaunded, yea though it be morally certaine they ſhall neuer come thither, or elſe there to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered or ſlaine. And this is the point indeed whereupon they ſtand as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mirrour of all perfection, and attributed to their ſocietie alone. To which I anſwer firſt, that I could wiſh with all my heart, (and ſo could ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands in <hi>England</hi> wiſh the like) that their obedience were tried, and themſelues mortified to perfection, aboue all ſeculars in their quiet depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of this land, and go and liue where they liſt afterward, according as they and their ſuperiours ſhall thinke fitteſt for them, to make this their ſtate of perfection ſecure. But I doubt if they ſhould by neuer ſo powera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authoritie be called out hence; yea if it were from his Holineſſe, they would call him a Proteſtant for ſo doing, as now they do all ſeculars or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that wiſh it, both for their owne, and the generall good, quiet and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of our Prince, countrie, preſent State, and all Catholikes in generall borne vnder <hi>Engliſh</hi> allegeance. And againe if they ſhould be thruſt out and expelled by force, as like enough they are to be ſo by ſome ſudden vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore &amp; rebellion, or inuaſion procured by them: as a Gent. of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and an entire friend and follower of one Father <hi>Ouldcorne,</hi> ſeemed to ſay no leſſe of late: vz. <hi>That theſe contentions muſt end with bloud:</hi> and I verily beleeue he ſaid true: bloud muſt and will end it indeed, if they be not thruſt out in time: but curſed be theſe bloudie maſſacrers that are the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of it. Then doubt I on the other ſide theſe perfectly mortified ghoſtes, will be ſo farre out of patience, as they will looſe all their merite without
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20192:35"/> recouerie: and the rather am I ſo perſwaded, by reaſon of the great mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring ſorrow, execrations and curſes they vſed ſo pathetically, paſſionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and extreame outragiouſly againſt the King of <hi>France</hi> and his honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Councell, for expelling them thence, notwithſtanding their liues were all in his hands: ſo that whereas he might iuſtly haue put them all to death for traitors, arreſted vpon high treaſon, yet granting them their liues <hi>gratis,</hi> and alſo giuing of them three French crownes a peece, with a certaine time of leaue to prouide for themſelues to depart: they moſt ingratefull of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (a vice, to be plaine with you, which is generally noted in them all as a natiue braunch, proper to <hi>Nicke Machiuels</hi> crue, neuer to be thankfull lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then they are in hope of a greater benefite thereby) forgetting, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not any way acknowledging any benefite, mercie or lenitie: but all extremitie, tyrannie and crueltie ſhewed towards them by the King, fell into ſuch tearmes of malitious ſpeeches againſt his <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Maieſtie: as ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the low Countries, &amp; confines of <hi>France</hi> at the time of their expulſion, did note and report vnto me <hi>in verbo ſacerdotis</hi> that the common people hearing it, and how vehemently they ſpoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the peace then in hand betwixt theſe two potent Kings <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Catholike,</hi> did verily thinke they would haue pulled them downe and ſtoned them in the ſtreete.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what perfection theſe mortified men are come vnto, and whereunto their oſtentation of obedience to their ſuperior doth tend. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience indeed is a ſpeciall vertue, but one ſwallow makes no Sommer: one vertue makes no creature perfect in his life, one onely defect makes a priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but all helpes muſt concurre to euery perfection. <hi>Vnitas est principium numeri, ſed vnus vel vnitas non eſt numerus niſi abuſiuè ſumptus.</hi> The fiue fooliſh virgins they did watch, they liued chaſt, they were obedient, they were diligent, they were carefull, they carried lampes with them, burning with indiſcreet fire of zeale, but they wanted oyle of charitie to keepe in the heate and make it perfect: and therefore were they reiected with <hi>neſcio vos.</hi> Well: yet admit this obedience of the Ieſuits to weare the garland of perfection and merite the crowne of glorie, what then? Is there none hath equall part with them, or may none be as perfect as any of them by this ſame meanes? Yes queſtionleſſe. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> our Apoſtle was ſent by Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> (ſurnamed the Great for his many rare excellencies and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) into this flouriſhing Iſle of <hi>England nolens volens,</hi> with commaund not to returne vntill he had conuerted this people and nation to the Chriſtian faith, or elſe loſt his life in defence of the ſame. And he came by vertue of his Holineſſe commaund: and vnder obedience worthily perfourmed the ſame to his great merite. How many Monks and Friers, and other both ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and religious perſons, haue gone, and do go continually with like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie when occaſion is offered, and vnder the ſame vow of obedience which theſe Ieſuits make their vaunt of? It were too long to ſtand to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20192:36"/> them, with what authoritie, and vnder what other obedience (vnleſſe a more perfect kind) do Seminarie Prieſts come into <hi>England,</hi> ſaue onely this alone? Where is then the difference of this great perfection which is in the Ieſuits aboue all other Prieſts or orders of religion? Where it is I know not: but where the contrarie is I can giue a ſhrewd gueſſe at it. It was ſaid of old: <hi>Cucullus non facit monachum.</hi> It is not the death but the cauſe that makes a Martyr. And we ſay now, that meate makes, and cloth ſhapes, and manners makes a man: and that all theſe faire ſhewes and flouriſhes in Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall vertues, may be without impeachment in their cauſes, and yet ſtark nought in the effects produced by them. And becauſe ſaith the Philoſopher that <hi>ex effectibus cognoſcitur cauſa:</hi> therefore by demonſtration <hi>à poſteriori</hi> it wil be proued, that the Ieſuits ſtate of perfection is ſtarke ſtinking nought, and their oſtentation of obedience meere hypocriſie, and a ſeditious arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, vaineglorious deluding of ſimple people with their vſurpate authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Is it alwaies a vertue and merite in thoſe <hi>qui trans mare currunt</hi> to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their liues in forreine lands, going either voluntarie or vnder obedience by commaund of their Superior? If the Ieſuites ſay it is not, (as it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede) then it followeth that they muſt graunt,<note place="margin">O that men wold but giue now and then an impartial glaunce vpon the Ieſiu s protects and principles of their abſurdities, then ſhould they ſee it <hi>luce clarius,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

In reſpect whereof we ſay (and true it is by generall opinion of all men) that two Chriſtians going into the warres together againſt the Turke, and both of them there ſlaine, the one may die a bleſſed martyr, the other be damned to hell without redemption: and then by conſequent, they muſt needes graunt that though the cauſe ſeeme neuer ſo iuſt yet the intention may mar all: &amp; that that which is known only to God alone during the time of hanging the ſame cauſe, the ſame is known to man after the effects haue diſcouered it. And ſo their oſtentation of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, obedience, perfection of ſtate, and I know not what is in pollicie by them to be kept ſilent: for burſt it out once into the effects, it will proue nothing but auarice, extorſion, couſinage, trecherie and treaſon. If they affirme (which were groſſe) that the very act of going vnder obedience be meritorious, and makes the habituated therewith perfect: then I inferre that vpon ſuch a generalitie, <hi>Mithridates</hi> filling all the <hi>Adriaticke</hi> ſeas with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, to moleſt the <hi>Romane</hi> Nauies, and to breake their forces, did cauſe a high merite to redound by that act to his couragious ſouldiers: (for feare makes cowards couragious in extremities) though queſtionleſſe many of them went for obedience, which had rather haue wiſhed themſelues halfe hanged to haue ſit ſtill at home, &amp; ſlept in a ſound skin amongſt their wiues and children. So a merchants factor going by commandement of his maiſter into <hi>Turkie, Barbarie, Perſia</hi> or elſewhere, committing himſelfe to <hi>Neptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> mercie, to winds and waues, and all aduerſe fortunes of ſea and land: yet becauſe thoſe that are bound they muſt obey, and perhaps though vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to haue taken that voyage in hand of himſelfe: yet going on his maiſter his coſt and charges, he takes it vpon him with great
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20192:36"/> alacritie and ioy of mind: and by conſequent meriteth greatly thereby, if this principle hold true with the Ieſuits. And a number of the like examples may be brought to ſhew their groſſe errour, or rather the fond opinion of many, that thinke vpon their inueigling perſwaſions, that a Ieſuite hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon him the moſt perfect ſtate and vocation of life, of any other who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Whereas in very deede it is (eſpecially as now they vſe it,) the moſt imperfect of all other, a very platforme, canuaſe, and deuiſe how to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and enrich themſelues with wealth, friends, and inſinuating of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into Princes Courts and affaires; and thus (forſooth) for obedience ſake theſe humble ſoules, muſt paſſe into <hi>India, Turkie, England, Scotland,</hi> and all nations, and be remoued, ſent for, and poſted euer (like merchants indeede that trafficke where moſt gaine is to be made by interchaunging of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, from one Mart, hauen, promontorie, or Monopole to another) and ſo another ſent in his place thither againe, or perhaps none at all if no commoditie be to be reaped thereby: either by holding in of ſome friends that would ſlip from them, or elſe by meanes of giuing intelligences of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires in thoſe coaſts neceſſarie to be made knowne.

But now if the caſe be propoſed, &amp; the examination made of ſuch articles as may either directly or indirectly boult out and make known the truth of the matter intended, &amp; then of due right to be examined: then and therein equiuocation is but a meere deuice of periurie, cogging and lying. As for example: what ſay you (ſaith the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate) if the Pope come in with hoſtile hand to inuade this Realme, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſet vp the Catholikes religion: whoſe part will you take, &amp;c? and the Catholike anſwereth, I will take the Queenes part: meaning to himſelfe, if the Pope will commaund me ſo to do: or for any thing further of my mind that you ſhall know. This I ſay is wicked cogging and vnlawfull, as being nothing elſe but a ſecret concealed treaſon. It being ſure that inuaſion, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile power and force of armes do denotate a population of the whole land, and no reſtoring (but <hi>per accidens</hi> only) of religion, or the Catholike faith at all.

Sixtly, vpon this ſlie deuice of equiuocation, whereby the Ieſuits hold it <hi>dogmatizando,</hi> that they may not only to our aduerſaries, but euen alſo to any Catholike Magiſtrate, yea to the Pope himſelfe, anſwer one way and meane another, ſo as impoſſible it is for any that is not a Ieſuit to know a Ieſuits heart: here-hence they haue gotten or arrogated vnto themſelues an immunitie of ſo ample priuiledge, as go where they liſt, neither Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Biſhop nor Archbiſhop may meddle with them, when they do amiſſe: <hi>ſtat pro ratione voluntas:</hi> their owne pleaſure are their guides: and ſo ſtrict a law impoſed vpon all others, where euer they liue, as do they but only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a matter, they may not be called in queſtion, nor once asked why they do it: ſo as their arrogancie is grown to that height now, as the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie (vnleſſe ſome few perſons deſirous to liue quiet, &amp; let all run on wheels) aſwell ſecular as religious throughout <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> are brought almoſt to a <hi>non plus,</hi> not knowing what courſe to take to reforme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Seuenthly, vpon this intollerable pride, hypocriſie and immunitie arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; whereby no Prince or prelate liuing can eſcape their tongs, pens, yea nor fiſts (if it come to banding) vntill theſe mortificats haue their wils, nothing being well done, nor any gouernment well managed without their direction, as wanting diſcretion, zeale, learning or ſomething, which theſe illuminates, made of a more excellent mould muſt perfect and reform in the groſſe headed ſeculars: there followeth then preſently after it, another deuice plotted of purpoſe to make it ſeeme meet to the ignorant multitude &amp; afterwards to others (for note this, that popularitie is the rouer they ayme at in all their proceedings, the <hi>mobile vulgus</hi> being euer wauering and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt to run vpon euery change) that all the whole Cleargie both Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and Monaſticall throughout all nations ſhould be ſubiect to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And to put this deuice in execution, <hi>England</hi> is made the maine chance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome this day.

                  <p>I Anſwer: firſt, that where there is one learned man of the Ieſuites, there are a hundred either of ſeculars apart, or of religious apart. Secondly, where there is one learned book written by any Ieſuit, there are a couple of thouſands written by others as learned (at leaſt if not more) as they are. Thirdly, the cauſe why ſeculars (eſpecially the Seminarie Prieſts in <hi>England</hi>) do not write ſo many, nor almoſt any booke at all, as the Ieſuits do &amp; haue done, is partly for want of money (without which no Preſſe will go) the the ſeculars and Ieſuits liuing apart in extreames: the former pining in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and therefore can ſet out nothing: the other ſurfetting in exceſſe, and therfore may ſet out what they pleaſe: partly alſo, for that the ſeculars haue bene euer againſt writing of any ſuch bookes, as might exaſperate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, or occaſionate a diſpleaſure againſt all, for ſome ſuch priuate perſons offences, which the Ieſuites quite contrary leaſt regarded. Nay, what bookes haue they written almoſt, but ſuch as are farced with rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſpiracies and treaſons, iuſtly occaſionating a generall perſecution v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs all thereby? Onely one Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> hath written ſundrie bookes (for I account not of Fa. <hi>Southwell,</hi> as whereof to make any oſtentation of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) and all thoſe of one practiſe or other in exaſperating either againſt her Maieſtie directly, as his <hi>Philopator,</hi> or againſt the whole State in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as his <hi>Doleman:</hi> or againſt all the bloud royall in common, as his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix:</hi> or againſt the whole commonwealth, as his <hi>Machiauell of oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickes,</hi> or book of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Councels againſt <hi>England,</hi> or againſt this or that Peere of this land in particular, as his <hi>Greenecoate</hi> or <hi>Scribe.</hi> And as for his booke of <hi>Reſolution</hi> which gets him all the praiſe, he hath or can deſerue, yet alacke, alacke, it is eaſie to lay fine threeds together, when they are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a mans hand: and as eaſie to tranſlate a work almoſt <hi>verbatim</hi> out of peecemeale copies into his mother language. Fourthly, the ſeculars vntill now of late had no meanes from beyond the ſeas for printing of any book: &amp; in <hi>England</hi> they durſt not venter (for offending the State) without leaue: whereas the Ieſuites haue alwaies had meanes both here and there, for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20192:42"/> what is it that mony cannot compaſſe? Fiftly, the Ieſuits haue learned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one ſpeciall tricke of <hi>Machiauell,</hi> which alſo was throughly practiſed of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his daies: and that was to be at compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with certaine Nobles and great perſonages in Princes Courts to ſpread abroad his bookes, with this prouiſo, that they ſhould report of euery thing he wrote to be rare, learned and eloquent, and himſelfe the moſt famous man of <hi>Europe</hi> for his pen in thoſe dayes: for pregnancie of wit, dexteritie of inuention, facilitie of paſſage, pleaſing accents, delightfull, with a naturall facilitie in all things: and then would he againe in recompence of this grace and fauour, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite their honorable eſteeme had, and cauſed generally to be had of him: ſet them foorth on the other ſide by dedicating of his bookes either vnto them, or taking ſome ſpeciall occaſion to write of them or their progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſound foorth the Panigeries of their praiſes, extolling them aboue the skies, for their Nobleneſſe, their heroicall hearts, martiall proweſſe, valiant acts, worthy feates, warlike exploits, honorable calling of parentage, by birth, bloud, and high renowne highly deſcended. And fame alwaies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the reports of Ecchoes, ſuch Nobles and Gentles, for natures por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture in the lineaments of their body, fine conueyance of their actions, not coyned by art, but naturally paſſing from them, as a forgetfull cuſtome by inſtinct of proper kind: comly geſture, with countenance haughtie, ſtern and champion-like, yet dropt with ſpots of beautie, bountie, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, intercepted with graces of mildneſſe, courteſie and affabilitie: at a word courtly, regardfull, pleaſing &amp; acceptable in al things: being the right compliants of times, comperters of ſages, and the full complements of all admirable aſpects, as the mirrors of vertue and all liuely graces. Both by theſe meanes ſhould be famous and reſpected, inquired of, talked of, peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. And all this that I haue ſaid concerning the pollicie of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> you may pleaſe to decipher out in the Ieſuits with ſupererogation of an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heaped vp meaſure. For let the perſon be neuer ſuch a dolt, dunce, or dotrel, or his actions neuer ſo baſe, ignominious &amp; diſhoneſt or ridiculous: or his words or writings neuer ſo ſimple, groſſe and exorbitant, or impertinent to the purpoſe: yet being a Ieſuit, oh! he is a rare man; another <hi>Saluſt, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> or <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> for eloquence, as was Father <hi>Southwell,</hi> but yet came ſhort of them: an other <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in preaching, as Father <hi>Ned Coffin</hi> (alas poore ſilly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>ſent. loquitur, &amp;c.</hi>) An other equal, nay far aboue that worthy pillar of the Church Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the Doctor Angelicall S. <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi> the moſt ſubtill diſputer Doctor <hi>Scotus,</hi> as is that top of wit Fa. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> not worthy to hold the candle before the meaneſt of any of all theſe, or ſundrie other far their inferiors. But what ſhould we ſay? fame flies farre: &amp; if the Ieſuits wanted this tricke of coggerie to make them ſeeme famous, nay matchleſſe, nay peereleſſe in ſetting out of bookes, and doing of other like exerciſes pertaining to learning, gouernment and knowledge, I would ſay they had no ſcholeriſme worth a blew button amongſt them, nor were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20192:42"/> they fit to foot the inſtep in <hi>Machiauels</hi> ſchooles. Sixtly, another cauſe there is why the Ieſuits workes and bookes are here in <hi>England</hi> ſo common, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and much talked of, and almoſt none other named, or at leaſt accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of at all. And that is forſooth an authority they haue gotten to their Archprieſt now, to ſtop all others from writing of any thing, be it good or bad, without his approbation or allowance: which he will neuer yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but with diſgraces to the Author, as experience hath tried it true. And beſides before this authority came, the Ieſuits as high Admirals or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of ſea and land, dealt ſo cunningly (few or none euer imagining ſuch an oſtentatiue ſleight and vaineglorious deuice) as was, to haue their owne doings onely praiſed, to lye cloſe couched and packt vp at euery mart) therein as few or no bookes came euer from beyond the ſeas, but of ſome Ieſuits ſetting forth: or if they did, yet did not the diſcharge of that peece in ſtriking ſaile, giue ſo ſound report thereof as of theirs: and ſo ſtill it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med there was no learning nor ſcholers, nor yet any one wiſe man, no nor ſound Catholike or good Chriſtian in the world, vnleſſe he were either a Ieſeuit, in <hi>re</hi> or in <hi>ſpe,</hi> or a broker for them.</p>

Secondly, for their inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of youth, &amp;c. I haue told you inough before: it is but a double diligence like to a Beares loue to his whelpes to pray for his owne paunch.

Yea, was not this one ſpeciall cauſe of foiſting in the Ieſuites readers into the Romane Colledge and other places? was not this one ſpeciall cauſe to hinder the <hi>Benedictines</hi> religious intent &amp; charitable deſignments: when they offered to haue brought vp and maintained 30.

Which theſe <hi>Momiſts, Zoiliſts, Ariſterkiſts,</hi> and enuious Ieſuits could not endure to heare of? was not this the cauſe of their Archprieſts late command that no youth ſhould go ouer to any Colledge without his approbation &amp; teſtimony giuen of him to the fathers? Yea and withall, hath not this bene the cauſe that many fine yong Gentlemen haue loſt their wits, &amp; haue bene made vncapable of all gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either in the Church or common-wealth euer after?

But rather quite contrary that they comming in with new innouations, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly prepare the way to ſome new hereſie, as the experience of all ages doth make apparant. Then let the Ieſuites take vp in time and vaunt (if vaunt they will) of ſome thing elſe more to their credit, and driuing of ſuſpition, iealouſie and irremoueable conceit to be had of ſome monſtrous hereſie to be in brewing amongſt them: the common ſaying being not more old then true, that that which one or two reports may well be falſe: but that which all men ſay muſt needes be true.

Which that reuerend good Prieſt, of a mild mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt &amp; ſcrupulous feare, writing ſparingly vnto me: atteſting (as his Prieſtly behauiour hath euer ſince approued it) that he was loth to meddle in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of any ſuch matter, being then in place where he was, rather to occupy the beſt thoughts of his paſſage here hence (not knowing when he might be called to his account) then to buſie his wits with calling to mind, what had
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20192:48"/> paſt in the <hi>Romane</hi> Colledge or elſewhere, during his abode there. And only that which he wrote was, rather to excuſe their impious dealings the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, being not ſo much nor ſo plainely deliuered as I had heard before.

                  <p>But to let theſe things paſſe, and to come to their ſacriligeous abuſe of that manner of meditation and method of holy exerciſe which was with more deuotion, and more fruitfull progreſſe, practiſed, ere euer any Ieſuite was borne, then it hath bene ſince amongſt them: although I do not deny, but it is very good, and wel ſet forth by them, as my ſelfe can partly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mine owne experience, hauing taken it at their hands: Mary the managing of a matter is all, and therein the intention is chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected: which is ordinarily knowne through the effects produced by it. For although that act, which is of it ſelfe euill, as we ſay <hi>intrinſice &amp; per ſe,</hi> can neuer poſſibly be made good: yet doth it not therefore follow <hi>è conuerſo,</hi> that an act which of it ſelfe is good, can no way <hi>per accidens</hi> be made euil; <hi>verbi gratia,</hi> for a man to kil his own father, or violently rauiſh his mother, can by no diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or other meanes euer be made lawfull, good or allowable: but yet a man intending to conuert a ſoule, and takes his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, with inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to enioyne him for penance to murther his Soueraigne, or commit ſome ſuchlike or farre leſſe horrible crime, that act of teaching, preaching, &amp; mouing the penitent to confeſſion, is good of it ſelfe, but yet the intention makes it ſtarke naught, &amp; damnable in him that vrgeth, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth the ſayd penitent vnto it. To this doth fitly ſymbolize S. <hi>Auguſtines quadruparte</hi> deſtinction ſaying: <hi>Eſt bonum bene factum: &amp; eſt bonum male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factum: Eſt malum malefactum: &amp; eſt malum benefactum:</hi> denotating by theſe two aduerbes <hi>benè &amp; malè,</hi> the intention: which may alter that <hi>per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens</hi> that otherwiſe is, or might be quite contrary <hi>per ſe.</hi> And ſo the Ieſuits exerciſe: although in it ſelfe it did far ſurpaſſe and go beyond all others in matter, manner, and method obſerued in the actuall vſe of it: yet when it is done for an euill end, as to make it a conicatching or coſening tricke, or ſleight to picke a man or womans purſe, nay to get all their lands by it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the intention wicked and naught, and by conſequent the act is naught in them. Of this exerciſe then (becauſe it is a point of moſt importance, as wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with many good Catholikes are mightily abuſed both men &amp; women: and eſpecially ſuch as be of the mildeſt, ſweeteſt &amp; gentleſt natures, fitter indeed for heauen then to liue amongſt ſuch counterfeits on earth) I will ſet you downe, a relation made by a reuerend Prieſt, a moſt ancient &amp; worthy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20192:49"/> and long ſufferance, may iuſtly apall and abate the heate of the prowdeſt Ieſuits haughty hart within this land. His words are theſe, or to this effect ſet downe as followeth.</p>
                  <p>When the Ieſuits find one fit for their turne: they inſinuate themſelues into him, keepe him company, vſe him with all kind of ſweet behauiour and courteſie: &amp; pretend to haue an eſpeciall care of his well doing in al things, but principally how he may attaine to be in high fauour with God. To which purpoſe they enter by degrees into certaine diſcourſes of hell: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they omit none of their skill, by authorities, examples, and large amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to make the ſame as terrible, as poſſibly they can. By which courſe they caſt the party in time, into great feare and penſiueneſſe (all which were well done, if it were to a good end.) Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue held on after this ſort ſo long, as they thinke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient intermingling now and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promiſes as are made in the Scriptures to the children and ſeruants of God. Here they omit no part of their skill to deſcribe the heauens: the Maieſty and glory of God: the happy eſtate and ioyes of the Saints in that euerlaſting kingdome: which is prepared for thoſe, who in this life ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Chriſtian faith, and become obedient children in their true calling vnto their holy mother the Catholike Romane Church.</p>

As when Gentlemen being borne to great poſſeſſions, do thinke it ſufficient for them to follow the ſteps of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors: eſteeming that to be the calling, which God hath prepared for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whereof it commeth to paſſe diuerſe times, that they make ſhipwracke of all their eſtates, and fall into many calamities: God approuing and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no calling, which is not entred into by direction of his holy ſpirit. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (ſay they) through their owne raſhnes, are ſpirituall perſons, who ought by Gods ordinance to haue bene of the laity: and many on the other ſide are (as we tearme them) lay men, which ought to be Eccleſiaſticall: both of them periſhing in their owne courſe, through their owne faults: in that they had no care to learne and know their owne proper calling ordained for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which God would haue ſanctified to their eternall comforts: if they would haue vſed the meanes to haue vnderſtood and imbraced them.</p>
                  <p>In the deſcription of theſe meanes the height, the depth and the breadth of all their coſening doth conſiſt, as being the exerciſe it ſelfe aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20192:49"/> Of theſe meanes they do at the firſt ſpeake only in a generality: entring into a diſcourſe of the louing kindneſſe of God, that he hath prepared a way, whereby euery man that liſt may know, how to ſerue him: whereinto ſo many as will enter, may haue aſſurance in themſelues by the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt, what their ſeuerall vocations are, whereunto God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, and which they muſt vndertake, if euer they meane to come into the ioyes and conſolations of the Paradiſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus after they haue layd theſe grounds, no maruell if the party ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly and kindly caried on, do fall into their traps Howbeit you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that in al theſe diſcourſes made to ſuch parties, they carry themſelues ſo aloofe, as that there may be no ſuſpition of their intents to draw them by ſuch their practiſes to their ſocietie. So as when the poore ſoules (as rauiſhed with a deſire to attaine vnto the ſaid meanes or exerciſe ſo highly commended: and ſo neceſſary for all that truly thirſt after the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and ioyes of heauen) do intreat the holy fathers, that they may be receiued into that happy and bleſſed exerciſe: their motion at the firſt in that behalfe, the good fathers ſeeme little to regard: ſaying that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture this their deſire proceeds of paſſion: and therefore their maner is to leaue them in this ſort for the firſt time: adding with what deliberation and iudgement that ſacred exerciſe is to be vndertaken: as being the ladder of <hi>Iacob,</hi> whereby they may aſcend into the third heauen, and there ſee and behold the admirable miſteries of God.</p>
                  <p>If the party thus caught be of great poſſeſſions, wealth or parentage, they are much the ſooner intreated to admit him to this exerciſe. The manner whereof is thus. The party at the time appointed comming to the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who muſt deale with him, is recluded from the ſpeech of any body but the ſayd father for a certaine time. Vpon his firſt recluſion the father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto him, and giueth him a meditation to ſtudy vpon, for ſome foure or fiue houres: willing him in the meane while carefully to remember all the cogitations that do come into his mind. The ſayd foure or fiue houres expired, in commeth this good father, and then the party muſt be confeſſed: and is to reueale all his particular thoughts, of what matter ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer good or bad, that came into his mind all the time of his aforeſayd meditation: which done, the father giueth the party another meditation with the like inſtructions to the former: and after the like diſtance of time returning, he heareth his confeſſions againe: and thus the party is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed diuerſe times euery day the ſpace of nine daies, or thereabouts, which is a paſſing good order, able to mortifie a heart of flint: But harken what followeth.</p>
                  <p>In this ſpace the holy father hauing framed the ſaid meditations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne drift: for example, if the party be rich, then of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, &amp; the vanity of worldly riches. And further perceiuing by his confeſſions, his diſpoſition, and what effect the ſaid meditations haue

Whereupon the party hath time to conſider with himſelfe, whether he wil be a <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, Benedictine, Ieſuit</hi> or what he liſt. And yet thus far, well. But that time expired, the holy father entreth into a new ſtratageme.</p>
                  <p>The ſayd party exerciſed (as is before expreſſed) comming thus vnto his electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath peraduenture determined to be a <hi>Dominicane:</hi> or to take ſome ſuch other courſe, as he himſelfe hath thought of. So as when the ſaid holy father commeth vnto him, if he find him bent to any other profeſſion then to be a Ieſuit, he beginneth to caſt many doubts, and collecteth at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by ſomething that he hath confeſſed vnto him, that his ſaid choice is not agreeing to ſuch godly motions, as the ſpirite of God wrought in him in the time of his exerciſe: and therefore aduiſeth him to conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe better of his choiſe, that the ſame may be ſutable to the ſaid motions of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion is, that the holy fathers by this meanes hauing ſundry poore ſoules in their hands, to worke them by turnes, deuiſes and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as they liſt, neuer leaue or ſuffer them to be quiet, vntill (if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) they make choiſe to be of the ſociety of <hi>Ieſus:</hi> if in all theſe practiſes with them, they find them fit men for their turne. Howbeit ſometimes it commeth to paſſe that the ſaid deuout fathers do meete with ſuch perſons, as will rather chuſe to be of ſome other order, do what they can, then to be Ieſuits, for that <hi>ſpiritus vbi vult ſpirat.</hi> In which caſes, when their practiſes to win the parties for their learning, ſtrength of wit, paretage, &amp; other good parts more then ordinary do faile: they deſiſt from dealing with them by litle and litle, &amp; ſo in the end giue them quite ouer: (meaning nothing leſſe, then by ſuch their paines to increaſe the number of any other order of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons:) and leaue them to take what courſe they liſt. But yet with this fruit of their exerciſes, that they will neuer loue or endure them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but raile on them, and plague them ſo much as is poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe they vndertake for their wealth and large poſſeſſions, although ſuch things be an hinderance from entring into any religious profeſſion at all: yet do the Ieſuits ſo farre preuaile, as for the moſt part they either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure them to be Eccleſiaſticall Ieſuits, if they haue any tollerable gifts beſides their riches: and then all that they haue muſt be ſold, and the mony com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the fathers diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: or at leaſt they draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be lay brothers,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20192:50"/> finding none other good ſtuffe in them. In which caſe they get from them, either all or moſt part of their riches, and turne them either to be ſome of their officers, or leaue them at large to be practiſers for them in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as they thinke fit to employ them in abroad: as to be ſoliciters for them, and to ſtirre vp the peoples charitie to that ſocietie: not ceaſſing to perſwade ſo many as they can to follow their example.</p>
                  <p>This was the effect of one M. <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and M. <hi>Druries</hi> exerciſes, vz. that they got from them all that euer they had: and then employing them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid, procured the Popes bleſſing for them (for the better appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto them their new calling) as appeareth in the faculties granted to Fa. <hi>Parſons, Campian, Heywood,</hi> &amp;c. about 20. yeares ſince. The euent of which proceedings with the ſaid Gentlemen was ſo apparant, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe greatly diſliked of ſuch exerciſes, in ſomuch as ſome in ieſt would ſay: <hi>ſuch a one is Gilberted, and ſuch a one is Druried.</hi> And others againe would ſay to the like effect: <hi>they ſhall neuer Gilbert me, nor Drurie me, nor couſin me with ſuch their holy ſleights.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond Act enacted, or ſtatute made in that high infernall Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, was concerning the Church and Abbey lands, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That foraſmuch as there be an hundred Biſhoprickes great and ſmall in theſe three kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with well nigh 20000.

                  <p>Theſe with other circumſtances and particulars being ſet downe, no man can iudge otherwiſe, but it was a worke fit for that Synodicall court to

But all muſt be vnder the holy ſociety of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> preſently vpon the eſtabliſhing of the ſpiritual monarchy. Which done, their father General or Prouinciall muſt call out foure Ieſuits &amp; two ſecular Prieſts, who muſt be alſo demy Ieſuites, elſe all were naught. Theſe ſixe Vicars (I pray God not of hell, for of heauen they are not, they ſmell ſo ranckly of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> and <hi>Bruſes</hi> pure ſynodall miniſtery) like ſixe Dutch Peeres (of whom the Prophecies talke) or ſo many mighty Lords, ſhall haue the lands, mannors, Lordſhips, parſonages, monaſteries, and what ſoeuer elſe belonged to Church or cloiſter, reſigned ouer into their hands: allowing to the Biſhops, Parſons and Vicars, competent ſtipends &amp; penſions to liue vpon: according as Biſhops Suffragans &amp; Montſeniors haue allowance in other Catholike countries, or rather as the <hi>Turkes, Baſſaes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ianizaries</hi> vnder him are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.

The Colledges in both Vniuerſities muſt be likewiſe in the power of theſe mortified creatures. No Biſhop, nor Parſon, nor Vicar, nor fellow of any Colledge muſt be ſo hardy as once to demand an account what is become of their reuenues, lands and Lordſhips. If they do, this ſhall be the anſwer: <hi>mirantur ſuperiores, &amp;c.</hi> or in plaine tearmes: how dare you ſeeme to inquire, how a Ieſuite diſpoſeth of any thing, being peculiarly guided by the Spirit, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The fift ſtatute there made, was concerning calumniation, not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that ſtatute of Aſſociation: I meane in Father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſenſe, as he in <hi>Greencoate</hi> makes it ſeeme to haue bene put in at the procurement of the Earle of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> or like the Proclamation he there talkes of to haue bene made by his Lordſhips procurement, againſt talkers of ſuch great mens do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as he was: whilſt be himſelfe might calumniate and call in queſtion whom he pleaſed. And ſo conformably hereunto doth this Ieſuiticall act of detraction or ſtatute of calumniation tend, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to bar all men from ſpeaking of Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> that bleſſed liue Saint, or any other Ieſuit whoſoeuer: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch rare men, as neither are their actions to be ſifted, canuaſſed, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced by any ſecular Prieſt whoſoeuer (perhaps the Pope excepted if he keepe ſilence, and ſeeme not to diſlike of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which if he do not, haue at him amongſt the reſt with heaue and hoe rumbelow:) neither can it be otherwiſe thought of, but as an act and ſigne of an euill ſpirit, and vnſound in religion for any one, that dare take that courſe, they being religious men, nay Ieſuits: and Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> of all the reſt, the rareſt wiſe man of our nation, moſt familiar with Princes, admired at in <hi>Spaine,</hi> reuerenced in <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; only hated in <hi>England,</hi> which is a ſufficient argument of his integritie, &amp; a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt token of their euill affection to the Catholike church and religion, that talke againſt him. This colluſion of Ieſuiticall ſanctitie cauſed a <hi>prouiſo</hi> in the foreſaid ſtatute, that whoſoeuer did offend a Ieſuit, or ſpeake againſt this <hi>high councell of Reformation,</hi> it ſhould be lawfull for the Fathers, or their Syn-odicall miniſters to defame, deſtract and calumniate him or her at their pleaſure, be, who they ſhall be, Noble, Peere, or Prince, Biſhop, Cardinall, or the Pope himſelfe. For which cauſe, and for the better vnderſtanding of the ſaid ſtatute, they hold two propoſitions: one is, that detraction is lawfull in generall: and ſo was it practiſed at <hi>Wiſbich</hi> by a Ieſuit: affirming that there were ſo many and grieuous enormities there committed amongſt the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that Fa. <hi>Weſton</hi> and his adherents were conſtrained to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the other Prieſts: and being charged to name ſome particulars, or if he could not, he was to be reckned of for an iniurious calumniator, &amp; ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20192:54"/> therein to haue offended greatly in ſlaundering the whole houſe: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, nay: my words were generall, and therefore I offended none. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other propoſition is for particulars, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that whatſoeuer particular perſon be he priuate or publike, and that eminent or a chiefe, is directly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, they neuer muſt leaue him, but calumniate, ſlaunder and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent new matter againſt him to death. Thus did they calumniate Doctor <hi>Gifford,</hi> and maligne him to this day (a man of good deſert, and of as many good parts, abilities and graces, as euer paſt the ſeas in this age, and hath not his better, if any be his equall, of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, beyond the <hi>Engliſh</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean now aliue.)

                  <p>The prouiſo in the ſtatute is this: <hi>ſcil.</hi> whereas before it was agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, that a father of the ſociety might authorize any of his ſubſtitutes or confederates, or of himſelfe, detract, defame, and calumniate any perſon that ſhould ſeeme oppoſite to their holy deſignements, this being thought very conuenient for the preſent: now be it further enacted thus: that for and in conſideration of the premiſes to aduance the father by traducing all others through diſcommends of all their talents, abilities, and graces in gouernement, learning, diſcretion, vertue and pollicie, it may be lawfull not onely to take away their good name, but euen alſo their life if neede require, <hi>propter bonum ſocietatis.</hi> Prouided alwayes that if the party before defamed be dead, or bis backe broken with ſlaunders or other miſhap, ſo as he is neuer able to riſe to any honour afterwards: and withall if now the aduancement of his credite (before diſgraced notoriouſly, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intent and meaning) may ſerue their turnes to worke ſome inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience or hinderance to a third perſon whom likewiſe they do maligne and hate: That then and in that caſe (the party eſpecially being out of the way, and thereby incapable of the honour which happily <hi>inter viuos</hi> might accrue vnto him, through the panegiries of ſuch praiſes) they ſhould leaue no ſtone vnremoued to extoll him aboue Saint <hi>Paules</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where he ſaw that which was not to be reuealed to men on earth. This then being the prouiſo of the caſe: now followeth the examples of the canuaſe.</p>
                  <p>After the death of Cardinall <hi>Allane,</hi> the Ieſuites fearing leaſt Doctor <hi>Lewis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caſſana</hi> ſhould haue had his place and bene made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, there were diuerſe patheticall diſcourſes in conference vſed of that worthie Prelate where ſoeuer they came: with many mournefull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects preſented to conceite of his loſſe, if ſuch a perſon ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto his place: and amongſt the reſt theſe were ſpeciall impreſſions by them imprinted in affectionate hearts towards his Grace and their holies: <hi>ſcil.</hi> It was there obiected what emnitie this Biſhop bare to their ſocietie: how that he ſtirred vp all their garboiles in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge at <hi>Rome:</hi> and that he neuer could endure the ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall his Grace: but was euer his vowed enemy, and one that had wrought him much ſpite, woe, and griefe in his daies. And to make this politicall canuaſe go current (or rather <hi>Machiuilean</hi> platforme, I could find in my heart to tearme it) to blemiſh the good opinion had of the Biſhop (thereby to trumpe in his way, vntill they might get him triced out of their way) they entred into a large diſcourſe of the Cardinals extraordinary ſingularities.

How all his whole ſtudie, chiefe endeuours, and greateſt care, was euer bent for the good of his countrey: for reducing of the ſame to the Catholike faith, and for the comfort of the afflicted, here and there and euery where? To what high dignities he was aduanced: how well he merited his place and calling: and how greatly honoured in the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> how much admired at by the reſt of the Cardinals: in what poſſibilitie to haue beene Pope, and how reuerenced by themſelues the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, &amp;c. Thus charitably they dealt with the good Cardinall after he was dead, and that they were ſure their praiſes giuen out of him could not then obfuſcate, obſcure, nor aboliſh one iot of their preheminence, or mirificall deſignements. The like example to this might be a correſpondent, and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fauour ſhewed to the ſaid Biſhop after his death, as the former was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Cardinals death. For according to the philoſophicall Axiome, as <hi>contraria iuxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt:</hi> ſo vertue and vice hauing ſuch a diſſocietie by conſequence of kind, that the one followes the other like form and priuation.

For this cauſe then it is plaine, that as theſe men neuer ſpoke well of the Cardinall after his death for any loue they bare vnto him: ſo neither did they vſe the like good ſpeech of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, for any entire affection towards his Lordſhip: but that which they did, was thereby to hinder and diſcountenance the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>Caſſanaes</hi> nephew <hi>Montſeigneur Hugh Griſſin.</hi> Which to performe ſtratagemically, they commended his ſaid Vncle exceedingly, to inſinuate thereby, that he did farre degenerate from his Vncles vertues. And a very like canuaſſe is all the whole diſcourſe of Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> in <hi>Doleman,</hi> conferred with his practiſe about the bequeſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crowne, now extolling <hi>Scotlands</hi> title to the skies: and then abaſing it in the preſence of <hi>Spaine.</hi> To day all wholly for the houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> to morrow as forward for the houſe of <hi>Parma.</hi> Now fawning vpon <hi>Derbie</hi> to bring Earle <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to deſtruction: and then vpon <hi>Eſſex</hi> to ſtirre vp Earle <hi>Robert</hi> to rebellion: and ſtill in the meane by entercourſe of parlee with anie, who either by their greatneſſe may comport with his ambition, or whom he by his platforme may couple withall, to bring this whole Iſle to a popular confuſion.

For amongſt other errors committed by him in that inhibition, this was one, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that he would ſuffer all <hi>Parſons</hi> ſeditious bookes to paſſe current, as his <hi>Philopator,</hi> ſpeaking moſt rebelliouſly againſt her Maieſty, and the whole State and Nobles of this land: his <hi>Doleman,</hi> entituling moſt traiterouſly the <hi>Spaniſh Infanta</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crowne: together with his <hi>Appendix</hi> fathered on Cardinall <hi>Allane</hi> being dead: his Letter to the Marques <hi>Huntley</hi> (to creepe in againe with <hi>Scotland,</hi> but ſent through <hi>England</hi> to be huffed, ruffed and vanted of) and ſundrie other of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates libels, lette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

An other error therein was; in that his authoritie (if he had any, and that it were not loſt againe) did extend onely to the cenſure &amp; allowance of ſuch bookes as were of matters of Religion and Eccleſiaſtical gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline: ſo as this booke I then was thought to be in hand withall was out of his commiſſion to meddle or deale with, either in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing or forbidding the reading or printing of it. A third was, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous boldnes, in that he would by vertue of his authoritie (ſuppoſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20192:60"/> it were ſuch, ſo great and ſo inuiolate as he takes vpon him to haue it) intrude himſelfe to meddle with forbidding bookes to be either read or printed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> without either asking leaue, or at leaſt giuing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Biſhop of <hi>Glaſco</hi> to vnderſtand thereof beforehand. A fourth was, the inſinuated ſuſpition of a Premunire he hath incurred alreadie (he may thank his good fathers for it) by his authoritie to be increaſed hereby, as ſeeking by this inhibition of printing or reading of anie booke that may touch a Ieſuite, (eſpecially that ſo daungerous a Polipragmon Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>) he ſhewes plainely that he would haue all the treaſonable practiſes concealed, not regarding what daunger of both bodie, ſoule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths wracke happen to anie, ſo as theſe new Fathers may haue their wicked deſignements. Many other particular points haue I noted, as being collected by neceſſarie ſequele to enſue vpon that Letter: whereof in the Apologie I intend to imptint of mine owne peculiar purgations I meane to treate at large. Onely this for the preſent he may pleaſe to know: that I neuer writ nor ſpake word in my life, that I dare not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in anie Court of Chriſtendome concerning theſe matters: ſo farre I am from all feare of exaſperating anie Prince or Peere, or incurring of anie daunger either in <hi>England</hi> (which I am bound in all reſpects to my dread Soueraigne and natiue land to be moſt warie of offending or hurting anie maner of way) or elſewhere. And if, as I haue ſuppreſſed the printing of that booke and ſundrie others for a time: let him not thinke it came vpon anie account or reckening I made of his ſuſpenſion for that cauſe: but for other reaſons which he and his may and yet do both miſſe of: though ſome of his aſſiſtants haue taken vpon them to know the cauſes why. And hereupon one of them of a brauado hath made his vaunt ſince my returne laſt out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he (another maner of man then I poore wretch to deale with Princes) hath written to his Maieſtie King <hi>Iames,</hi> exhorting him to embrace the Catholike faith and religion:<note place="margin">Were it not that the Ieſuits haue a ſpecial priuiledge in two things: one is, to make all things to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued as Goſpell be it neuer ſo falſ that they ſpeake or write: another to make al things to be iudged falſe be it as true as the Goſpell it ſelfe that any other ſhall write or ſpeake without their approbation. But if directly againſt them: out vpon it, it is not to be heard, ſpoken of, or once looked vpon. If theſe were not, and withall, that the vileſt parts that can be played are counted acts of zeale amongſt them if done by a Father: ſo as it may be any way couered with either of their two principles, <hi>ſcil. propter bonum ſocietatis, vel ordine ad Deum:</hi> otherwiſe I ſhould greatly muſe at the faire gloſe of father <hi>Southwell</hi> concerning father <hi>Parſons</hi> birth and education. It being moſt vntrue that Fa. <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> reports of him, ſcil. that hauing placed the vttermoſt of his ambition in the contempt of honor; and the higheſt of his wealth in voluntarie pouertie, will eaſily acknowledge his birth to haue bene of more honeſt then great parents. Yet were they not ſo meane, but they were able to affoord him ſuch education as might haue made his good parts a way to no ſmall preferment, &amp;c. All which is moſt falſe, a baſtard he was: vnhoneſtly begot, baſely borne, a <hi>Wolſey</hi> in ambition, a <hi>Midas</hi> in mundicitie, a traitor in action; which here I had not touched, had he ſpared his owne Soueraigne and bloud royall of this land.</note> which if he do, then all, all, all, euery true Catholike ſhould take his part for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crowne by this new ſtatiſts procurement. But what anſwer he had let himſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. I thinke it will be but a ſcorne, and he laughed at for a ſtale, in ſhewing his exorbitant audacious folly.</p>
                  <p>I may not here forget a fifth Statute, which I make no queſtion of but that Father <hi>Parſons</hi> would be moſt carefull to haue it throughly perfected
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20192:60"/> in that high Councell of Reformation for <hi>England:</hi> and it is to be thought that it goes alſo vnder the tenure of a prouiſo for legitimation of baſtards. For we may not imagine that Father <hi>Parſons</hi> was ignorant of his owne baſe eſtate, as being a ſacrilegious baſtard in the worſt ſenſe, ſcil. a <hi>ſpurias</hi> begotten by the Parſon of the Pariſh where he was borne, vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of a very baſe queane. This then being ſo, and he not ſo ſenſleſſe as to thinke but that he will find the Canon law more ſtrict in diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him for his irregularity, then the Ciuill or common law wil be for diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to inherite, &amp;c. (which may be a good caueat to him to looke to his orders, leſt otherwiſe he loſe his Rectorſhip, &amp; perhaps a better thing beſides:) there is no queſtion to be made of it, but that ſome cloſe ſtatute and prouiſo was cloſely made, and couertly foiſted in for enabling ſome baſtards in the ſpitefulle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And true it is, that this good Fa. <hi>Parſons (altas Cowbacke) filius populi &amp; filius peccati,</hi> or the verie fiend him ſelfe might be choſen to a kingdome by his doctrine, if any people would be ſo mad as to chuſe him for their king: becauſe the ſaid fury can tranſlate himſelfe into an Angell of light for an houres ſpace, though he turne into his helliſh vgly ſhape within a minute of an hower after, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Happie were ſome men, if they might haue a ſight of that ſtatute booke or huge volume of the high councel of reformation for <hi>England;</hi> no doubt but he ſhould find notable ſtuffe in it, that would ſerue for many purpoſes. But here I make an end, concluding out of the premiſes. 1. That the Ieſuits would take it in ſcorne to haue any poore ſecular or Seminarie Prieſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with them in prudence &amp; pollicie: conſidering that they dare beard the greateſt and higheſt perſons on earth in all things. 2. That in generall <hi>England</hi> for this age were able to ſet <hi>Nicke Machiauell</hi> to ſchoole; either in a good or a bad ſenſe of pollicie. 3. Yet taking <hi>Politia</hi> as <hi>S.

And conformably hereunto: foraſmuch as the Generall, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincials and the Rectors amongſt the Ieſuits are thoſe <hi>in cuius virtute cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri operantur,</hi> although many of the inferiour ſort of Ieſuits obeiſants may be, and I verily thinke are vertuous and good men of themſelues, and ſo do liue, and may no doubt continue ſo to their liues end: yet by reaſon of this ſubordination, and due obedience required in all inferiours to their ſuperiours, and all &amp; euery religious or ſecular order or ſocietie: as Friers, and Monks, to their Abbots, Priors and Guardians: theſe againe to their Prouincials, and theſe to their Generall, of <hi>Benedictines, Dominicanes, Franciſcans,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo in Cannons of Cathedrals to their Deane: Deanes, Archdeacons, Parſons, Vicars and all the reſt of the ſeculars and religious or Eccleſiaſtical and Monaſticall order, to their Biſhops: Biſhops to their Metropolitanes and Primates, &amp;c. and all theſe againe together with the Lords and other Nobles, Gentles and meaner ſubiects ſubordinate one vnder another to their Soueraigne Lord, Prince and King, &amp;c.

Which mind of theirs, for that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20192:63"/> it ſuffers a contradiction by reaſon of their religious profeſſion and vowe of voluntarie pouertie (containing in it many particulars oppoſite to all or any either eccleſiaſticall or temporall aduancement) therefore muſt they ſet all their wits a wool-gathering, making choiſe of the fineſt locks to worke vp this web in ſo ſmooth a loome; and that ſo couertly, and the threeds ſo layd and wrought in, cloſe couched together, as not a breake, knot, or anie the leaſt tuft or end of a threed, extrauagant of any mundane thought or ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar aduancement fiſhed for by them be left to be ſeene: but all pure zeale, ſpirituall contemplation, perfect mortification, Chriſtian renunciation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of honour, riches and all worldly eſteeme. Of this I neede to ſay no more, euery <hi>Quodlibet</hi> and Article miniſtring occaſion to talke of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits ambition, incrochment, and ſeeking for aduauncement by concealing ſuch defects &amp; wants in themſelues as are verie neceſſarie to be knowne, &amp; no way ought to be kept cloſe: neither will they be ſo hereafter, vnleſſe they mend their maners, and reforme themſelues in their order.

Otherwiſe, if needes he muſt take charge, then let him euer haue iuſt Iob his league written in his heart, <hi>Pepegi foedus cum oculis meis ne cogitarem quidem de virgine,</hi> and ſo concealing his owne infirmities, <hi>obſtando principijs</hi> as much as is poſſible <hi>ter dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rogando</hi> (yea <hi>ter centies</hi> with S.

But yet was it no pride in him at all, becauſe he both came in all humble wiſe, ſubmitting himſelfe to the meaneſt in all <hi>Kent,</hi> vntill he had conuerted them: and alſo for that he ſhould by giuing them place, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as he did an Apoſtle, haue preiudiced the See Apoſtolike, and the Popes Holineſſe: from whence as an ambaſſadour with Legatiue power he came: and alſo he ſhould therein haue preiudiced the Regall Maieſtie of King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> by name: who then hauing receiued the Catholike <hi>Romane</hi> faith at Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> hands (whom for that cauſe his Maieſtie had highly priuiledged) they did not ſend for him, but he ſent for them by authoritie from the ſaid King, who afterward alſo compelled them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame faith, and to renounce their hereſie, with the death of two thouſand Monks of <hi>Bangor</hi> Abbey at one time, procured by the King of <hi>Kents</hi> exciting the King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and others to warre vpon them, &amp;c.</p>

The ſecond ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing alſo before time alwayes giuen place, becauſe he was an intending perſon, &amp; one that thought himſelfe no ſmall foole, being able to diſpend 800. pounds by yeare; the ſaid ſecular Prieſt on a time reaſoning with him about theſe matters in contention betwixt the Seculars and the Ieſuites, and perceiuing his Ieſuiticall contempt of Prieſthood, tooke him by the ſleeue as they were going to diner (in a Catholike co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie where he was ſure) and thruſt him back, ſitting down before him, telling him in plaine, the caſe was altered: &amp; that though he had winked at his arrogancie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet nowe he muſt for the honor of Prieſthood make him knowe dutie, and giue place to his better, &amp;c. To the third, vnderſtanding that he had boſted much of his gentilitie and noble alliance, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was to be preferred before any other ſecular Prieſt that was not a Gentleman of equall calling with him, they iumping iuſt together vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a time at diner, he put him backe, and after the table was drawne taking him aſide, he ſaide: Sir, I vnderſtand you boaſt much of your gentilitie, preferring it before your Prieſthood, to the great diſhonour of your function: It is a fowle bird defiles his owne neſt: a baſe minded, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and vnworthy Prieſt that knowes not whether he takes his place accordingly or no to his dignitie and calling: and as worthie to haue the skin razed, cut off, and fleyed both from head and hand, and ſo degraded, as an abuſer of nobleneſſe and gentrie deſerues to haue his colours reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, his armes puld downe, and his coate puld ouer his eares &amp; ſo degen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for euer after. Know you therefore firſt that it is no note of pride in a gentlewoman of Royall bloud maried to one of Noble, to take place of her Ladie mother in law, or her owne mother in ſome caſe, if matched with one of honour borne, and highlier deſcended then her parents are. Secondly this is the difference betwixt ſpirituall and temporall Gentrie, that the former by Prieſthood is charactered in the ſoule, and therefore
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20192:65"/> may it be prophaned, and the partie diſgraced, the ſtampe can neuer be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: whereas the latter may not onely be prophaned, but as clearely taken away, as if he had neuer bene. Theſe two ſpeeches going currant, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that a Duke being proued a traitor is made but a yeoman, and ſcarce ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall a man: but a Prieſt though an Apoſtata, yet can neuer be vnprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted againe. Whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that as worſhip yeeldeth, where honour comes in place, and therefore a Noblemans ſonne being dubbed Knight, rather looſeth his place, and diminiſheth or obſcureth his honour then any way increaſeth it, vnleſſe it be by name to his wife, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her a Madame of a Miſtreſſe: ſo gentrie is augmented, where prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is charactered: and therefore a diminution of honour to inſert gently, as an argument of a prieſtly title, or eccleſiaſticall dignitie. Thirdly then and laſt of all it followeth hereupon,<note place="margin">As Prieſt amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt Prieſts take their place agreeing to their ſenioritie of prieſthood: ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles amongſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and gentles amongſt gentles, according to their ſenioritie of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet as we ſee it often hapneth, that ſome gentles by their audacity, others by reaſon of ſome great friend, or affied potentate in Court or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: others by their wits being of quicker ſpirits, &amp; withall hauing many better parts in them for to winne fauour and merite the place of aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then other ſeniors of their degree &amp; calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their welth and preſent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, being otherwiſe farre inferiour, &amp;c. ſo the like doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen often amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt Prieſts vpon the ſame occaſions, which ſometimes may be tollerable &amp; ſometimes not.</note> that Prieſts amongſt Prieſts take their place according to the ſenioritie of their Prieſthood, (vnleſſe either by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Doctorſhip, or ſome ſingular other endowment attending on their function it be otherwiſe allowed of and giuen vnto them) clearely abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from all reſpects had to their generous bloud therein. And ſome moue a doubt, whether a Noble mans ſonne comming to be prieſted, haue any prerogatiue giuen aboue other Prieſts by reaſon of his Nobleneſſe: and queſtionleſſe if he be a Monke, Frier, Ieſuite, or other religious perſon, he looſeth the place and title of his former honour, as dead to all ſuch titles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall, as whoſe proper eſſence is not inherent in the ſoule. But if he be a ſecular Prieſt, then it ſeemeth he keepes his place of honour ſtill, becauſe as I told you in part before in the forenamed <hi>Quodlibet</hi> of Fame and Report, an abſolute Prieſt by the lawes Canon and Ciuill is a Knights fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in place taking, but not aboue: and by conſequent as a Noble mans ſonne takes place of an ordinarie Knight that is not equally Noble as well as he: ſo doth he alſo of a Prieſt, &amp;c. But now whether in place taking it be a diminution of his Honour to be prieſted or not: there may be a queſtion: and I ſay it is not, by reaſon of the perſon whome he repreſents, which is the Deuine Maieſtie of God, his Omnipotent maker and moſt mercifull Redeemer. For like as <hi>Moyſes</hi> by the <hi>Leuiticall</hi> lawe, appointed an order amongſt the <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Prieſts, that they ſhould be in degrees one aboue another, vntill they came <hi>ad ſummum Pontificem:</hi> which he did aſwell to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid confuſion amongſt themſelues, if all were equall, as they were for two thouſand yeares ſpace and more (during the law of nature, the firſt borne of euery familie being alwaies a Prieſt, Lord and King, or Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ouer the reſt of his familie and kindred,) as alſo to prefigurate the like order now kept throughout the Chriſtian world, vnleſſe it be among the obſeruants of the Puritanes and Ieſuites platforme and principles: yet ſtill ſtoode this ſentence true, pronounced by the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after <hi>Moyſes</hi> gaue the law, that <hi>Labia ſacerdotis cuſtodiunt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiam &amp; legem requires ex ore illius, quia Angelus Domini exercituu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt:</hi>

For father <hi>Parſons</hi> being counſelled by the Phiſitians to keepe his ſtomacke warme, ſent his brother for ſcarlet to make him a ſtomacher, who of likelihood ſo ſoone as euer he heard the name of ſcarlet, he was poſſeſſed vpon the ſudden with ſo affectionate an opinion of his brothers aduancement, that forgetting his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to haue onely a ſtomacher, he procured two Marchants to carry in a whole wagon loaden with diuerſe peeces of ſcarlet, to his brothers lodging for making of his Cardinals robes, giuing it out by the way to all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance both going and comming, that his brother foorthwith ſhould be made a Cardinall.</p>
                  <p>When this ſurly father ſaw ſuch packes of ſcarlet brought vnto him, no maruell though he greatly wondred at it: but finding his brothers error, he was in a great chafe, and mightily confounded, as eaſily ſeeing what ſport it would be to thoſe that ſhould heare of it.

All which the wiſer ſort do ſee it but an Atheall deuice to hide from the world their abhominable facts: as though it were a ſinne to make knowne a traytour, an hereticke, an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata, an Atheiſt, a coſiner, a cut-purſe, a theife, a murderer, or a knaue in graine, &amp;c.</note> But if the caſe concerne himſelfe onely, or his owne ſole corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, company or ſociety, in oppoſition againſt another, either equall or ſuperiour to it: then is it moſt odious in the ſight of God ſo to do. And this is a right Atheall <hi>Machiuilean</hi> deuice of the Ieſuits, who paſſe all that euer yet were for detraction, and taking away a mans good name: yea euen when they haue tormented a man to death, yet haue they moſt ſlie and cunning ſleights, to make it ſeeme apparant they neuer did ſuch a thing: and withall to make the party thus crucified by them, yet ſtill to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of all the world as <hi>maledictus</hi> and an iniurious ſlanderer of them. Nay, which is admirable, they haue gotten ſuch a hand ouer the ignorant multitude, as euen theſe things which are written and diſcouered of them to the ſauing health of many a ſoule, that otherwiſe would be drowned in hereſie, and ſinke in ſinne by following of them, beſides their preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby from falling into the danger of the temporall ſword, by this tribe of traitors and conſpirators: yet haue they gained peoples hearts ſo farre as they will neither reade nor heare of their owne dangerous and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſtate (if they hold on) whereunto they are brought by them. But on the contrary cry out of all bookes, letters and ſpeeches, that may tend to the diſcouery of theſe mens neuer heard of more Atheall and great impiety. Which drift of theirs is nothing elſe but a meere ſorcery, charme, or inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to caſt poore ſoules into ſome apoplexy, lethargy, or other drunken diſeaſe, or ſweete poyſon that may ſooneſt worke at their hearts (for the ſweeteſt poyſon is a toade: and therefore the ſpeedieſt death) and lull them aſleepe, vntill they be paſt recouery, and then rowſing them vp, they ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted are like madmen, or ſuch as runne to go hang, drowne, kill, or burne themſelues: as many haue in the froth of their phantaſticall, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious curſed zeale: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet whoſoeuer ſhould haue ſought to haue ſaued, preuented, or perſwaded to take a better courſe, and to renounce the diuell and all ſuch falſe illuſions, perſwaſions and ſuggeſtions put into their heads by man, woman, or wicked ſpirite: they would haue bene ready to haue

And euen ſo many otherwiſe deuoute Catholikes led away with a vaine and erronious conceit had of theſe new Scribes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees and hypocrites the Ieſuits: are brought into ſuch a fooles paradice as it is probable, if ſome did ſee them ſinke downe quicke into hell, they would be ready and intreate to go with them, imagining they were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whereſoeuer a Ieſuit were amongſt them. Which is no leſſe blaſphemy then to affirme <hi>viſionem beatificam</hi> or <hi>beatitudine à preſentia diuina proflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem</hi> to be appropriated vnto them. Neither neede any to wonder here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at (though no Catholike nor true Chriſtian heart but may lament it) ſeeing of late yeares that abſurd pſeudochriſt <hi>Hacket</hi> had ſo many followers as this wretched Polipragmon <hi>Parſons</hi> in his <hi>Philopator</hi> doth affirme, that the vaunts thoſe baſe companions (<hi>Hacket</hi> and his company) then made (<hi>ſcil.</hi> of 100000. to be of their mind in <hi>England</hi>) is very probable to be true: taking Puritanes, Barrowiſts or Browniſts, Familians, Anabaptiſts and Atheiſts all put together: and knowing the Ieſuits haue a more plauſible and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes to deceiue poore ſoules then any of theſe: yea more colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deuiſes then the familie of Loue: who at the firſt ſet out bookes as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikly written as any could be: ſo as you ſhould hardly haue perceiued any hereſie, or any other villany to haue lurked in them: vntill the very vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, Epilogue, or concluſion in the laſt chapter, leafe or paragraffe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelfe once noted how cunningly they dealt to delude the ſimple and ignorant, with a very like perſwaſion to this of the Ieſuites, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That all being bound to ſeeke for perfection which conſiſted in renunciation of property in any thing, but to haue all common as it was (ſay they) in the Apoſtles time, when euery man and woman ſold all that euer they had, came and did caſt downe the money at the Apoſtles feete, and liued in common together: none taking any thing of their owne but as the Apoſtles aſſigned them. So this ſtate of perfection being (ſay the Familians) quite extinct and gone out of the Chriſtian world: we are thoſe whom God hath illuminated to repaire, reſtore, reduce, and make perfect the ſame againe, &amp;c. And doth not I pray you the Ieſuits doctrine and vaunt of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection tend to the ſame end, in as bad, if not a worſe manner then the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians? Reade the ſecond <hi>Quodlibet</hi> of plots by doctrine, for your better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in this matter. And ſo to returne to the Atheall order in pollicy, obſerued by the Ieſuites in defamation and detraction of others for their owne aduantage. Although they do it by ſundry meanes: yet ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes they haue for making their platforme of aduancement to a ſpirituall monarchy, ſtrong and impregnable (if it were poſſible) as when I haue done with theſe ten <hi>Quodlibets</hi> which containe as you ſee each one of them ten a peece, and euery one of theſe ten moe (one with another, which amounts to a thouſand) yet ſhall I be ready, and perhaps put it in practiſe, to make vp a new greater volume then this of ſo many moe: the very complementall and hiſtoriall ſumme of all plots, practiſes, ſtratagemes, pollicies and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20192:68"/> deuiſes that euer either art, wit or mallice could or hath inuented: being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred, refined, poliſhed, and reduced into a formall method by them. But to auoide prolixity ſo much as I may, and diſcouer them as they are: I will onely take one principle or <hi>maxime</hi> of their miſchiefes, obſerued by them for this matter, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>In the practiſe of detraction there is great skill to be vſed many wayes: but the chiefe points to be kept are theſe two, the one that the matter haue ſome ſhew of probability in it ſelfe: <hi>verbi gratia</hi> as to excuſe a modeſt, graue, &amp; ſober man of drunkenneſſe, who neuer taſted of any wine, ſider or ſtrong-beare in all his life: the preſumption muſt be this, (with witneſſes of it:) to wit, that he was ſeene twice or thrice go in or come out of a Tauerne or Alehouſe, &amp;c. ſo to accuſe another (though as innocent as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> or <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanna</hi>) of fornication or adultery: the preſumption muſt be that he found ſuch two together alone in a chamber, or other place of ſuſpition, &amp;c. there being no man nor woman liuing but may be thus calumniated and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in whatſoeuer a right Atheiſt liſteth. Then the ſecond point is: that hauing a ground <hi>ab exemplo</hi> to build vpon, what kind of detraction he pleaſeth, he muſt alwayes apply the infamy in iuſt oppoſition to the true ſame and report:<note place="margin">Of all other ſins detractation is holden of diuines to be moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous becauſe fame ſlieth far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, and would the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And no where ſooner doth this happen, then where theſe ghoſtly children are, that being giuen to looſe life, or other kind of wanton behauior or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous libertie, will not leaue off their leud courſes, nor endure to heare, or be aduiſed, ruled and perſwaded by their ghoſtly fathers in things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to their ſoules behoofe. Whereof I hauing tried many rufull experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: one amongſt the reſt was about a Letter ſent vnto me by a ſpeciall friend concerning an Honorable perſon verie notoriouſly defamed. Who hauing bene my ghoſtly child, it was obiected againſt me by my aduerſaries (ſome of the Ieſuitical faction,) that I knew of ſuch lewdneſſe and winked at it, &amp;c. This rumor although I ſtraight imagined it was but a deuice to make the parties and me fall in diſlike at leaſt one of the other: yet could I do no leſſe then ſignifie by letter ſo much vnto the partie on that behalfe, and for mine owne diſcharge wrote ſomewhat ſharply, and yet in all charitable manner to auoid ſuch company, &amp;c. But how it proued the effects ſhewed. One of the Ieſuits faction got preſently an intereſt there in that partie: and I was perſecuted, made odious to ſome of my friends, and threatned (of a carpet <hi>Cales</hi> knight) to be killed if euer he could meete with me: yet <hi>anima mea in manibus meis,</hi> it was the leaſt thing I feared. Another like to this was ſhortly after about one of no leſſe Honourable calling: of whom hauing heard and ſeene ſuch dealings as neither with a cleare conſcience could I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie longer winke at as the caſe ſtood, neither could I find anie hope or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of continuance there, after the yee were once broken by reaſon of the heauie perſecution I alreadie ſuſtained by certaine lay perſons of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites faction, that moſt baſely laboured by continuall ſlaunders, vile ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and moſt falſe reports to worke me out thence: hauing firſt gotten my ſtuffe conueyed from the partie in ſecret (as no whit deceiued in imagining what would followe) and then making a ſeparation betwixt him and his wench, cauſing her to go home to her parents: preſently hereupon there aroſe ſuch a huffing perrie againſt me that I was forced to betake me to my heeles; and euer ſince haue liued baniſhed from the place and companie of thoſe I euer dearly honored, regarded and affected. And theſe two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons are now moſt earneſt proſecutors of the Ieſuites and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts ſedition, falſhood and faction: notwithſtanding that the latter hath heretofore often <hi>conceptis verbis</hi> moſt deepely deteſted them, with many vowes, promiſes and proteſtations, neuer to admit of any of them, yea or of any other, that preiudice either our cauſe in generall, or

                  <p>When I came to <hi>Rome</hi> (ſaith he) I found the Colledge as a field with two hoſtile campes, within it father Generall and his aſſiſtants wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed and throughly reſolued to leaue the gouernement, &amp;c. And taking vpon him to ſhew the cauſes of thoſe long troubles in the Colledge, he ſaith: Some thinke that it is in great part the nature of the place that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendereth high ſpirits in them that are not well eſtabliſhed in Almighty Gods grace. For comming thither very young, and finding themſelues preſently placed and prouided for abundantly,<note place="margin">This ſpeech had bene fitly applied to father <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelfe, and may iuſtly be returned vpon him and his ſociety.</note> and acquainted daily with ſights and relations of Popes, Cardinals, and Princes affaires, our youthes that were bred vp at home with much more ſimplicity: and kept vnder by their parents and maiſters, more then the <hi>Italian</hi> education doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, forget eaſily themſelues, and breake out into liberty: I meane ſuch as haue run aſtray and loſt reſpect to their ſuperiours in <hi>Rome.</hi> And this opinion of the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance of place is greatly increaſed by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſtrangers: both <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French, Flemings</hi> and other nations: who affirme that they try by experience, that their people which liue in <hi>Rome,</hi> if they be not men of great vertue, do proue more heady afterwards and leſſe tractable then others brought vp at home. But yet to this other men of our nation adde a ſecond reaſon for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge which is at <hi>Rome,</hi> being a place whereunto many young men do reſort, onely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a deſire of ſeeing nouelties. When any come thither of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; find ſuch a commodity of ſtudy and maintenance &amp; themſelues in want and miſery, they made ſuite for that whereunto perhaps they had no true vocation from God, nor due preparation in themſelues, to ſo holy and high an eſtate: and ſo being once admitted, fell afterwards into diſorder, and to put out of ioynt both themſelues and others, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre this impious father ſheweth it to be the want of grace in ſome, and want of true calling in others, that they diſagreed with the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.

                  <p>RIches, honors, libertie, health, beautie, &amp;c. are accidents attending on the externall man, which go not by ſignes and ſymptomes: but by chaunce and change of fate or fortune, if any be, or may be tearmed ſo. Whereupon it cometh (as the Prouerbe goeth current) that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Clerks are not alwaies the wiſeſt men: though oftentimes it be ſo. For it is a thing impoſſible for a foole euer to be a profound Clerke, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeene, but that he which is very learned indeed, muſt neceſſarily haue a very good wit withal, elſe could he neuer attain to any great or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie knowledge: and then by conſequent, learning and wiſedome ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together in one ſubiect, make that perſon more fit for gouernement, then where there is but one of theſe alone. Yet to ſpeake conformably in anſwer to the article: preferment at all times, in all places, &amp; to all offices, goeth moſt by fauor of the Prince or ſuperior power: alſo by procureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

So that theſe externall and accidentall fauors, attending on the body, and not the indowments of the mind, or deſerts of the perſon, are often chiefe agents for aduancements.

And this for his part. Well, now to the third of that companie. Maiſter <hi>Fixer</hi> was the man moſt hated of them, becauſe he had ſpoken moſt on his Prince and countries behalfe againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and rebellious attempts and practiſes, as by a letter of his may well appeare, wherein he toucheth ſome pure ſpirited Ieſuites fautors with infection of the <hi>Spaniſh pippe</hi> (for theſe be his words) here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> But in concluſion, he was ſo vexed, lacerated, and calumniated by theſe Atheall Fathers, that he became almoſt paſt himſelfe: he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his protection, and in bitter teares often bewailing his hard fortune, that his innocencie could not ſaue his credite amongſt deuoute, vertuous, and true meaning Catholikes, as holden no better then a ſpie for the State, an Apoſtata from his profeſſion, and an Atheiſt in his religion: yea the good Gentleman that kept him, was ſo belaboured, as <hi>inuitis dentibus &amp; enſibus</hi> he was forced to leaue him: and yet, for that which is paſt, he hath not recouered his credite to this day, with that Puritanian Ieſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call faction.

                  <p>IF Cardinall <hi>Boromeus</hi> (whoſe rare vertues all Europe talked of, had had the hearing of this diſputation, and bene vmpier, moderator, or iudge pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount of this queſtion) he would ſure haue bene on the Seminarie and ſecular Prieſts ſide. For this good Cardinall obſeruing well the pride of the Ieſuits, their practiſes for inriching, aduancing &amp; bringing of themſelues to be admired at of all men (right <hi>Lucifer</hi> like, as much as to ſay, am I not the chiefe) and their conicatching deuiſes, for alluring of the fineſt wits, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of moſt towardneſſe, and thoſe of rareſt aſpects, and greateſt hopes to their ſpiery, hauing intelligence how they held in diuerſe Seminaries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Duchy of <hi>Millan</hi> the like courſe and ſtate, taken vpon them vnder colour of teaching and bringing vp of youths there, as they did in other countries and prouinces about him, and where euer they came, he thought them no fit men to remaine within his iuriſdiction. Wherupon he bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them out of all theſe places: eſteeming it farre more neceſſary to haue ſuch apt men, and thoſe of the fineſt wits, quickeſt ſpirits, and likelieſt to proue great clerkes, to become ſecular Prieſts (as thoſe appointed by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution diuine to take vpon them the care of ſoules: and therefore woe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them if they be ignorant in the law they are to giue and expound to their flocke and charge.) This he prudently conceited, as it was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, yea of bounden dutie for thoſe that were indifferent what ſtate of life they tooke them vnto in the Church of God, rather to haue them ſecular Prieſts then intruded into any order of religion or monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call life whatſoeuer: which intermedleth not <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> with any ſuch charge: but liue after the preſcript rules of their orders, priuate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as their vow and profeſſion bindeth them vnto: and none more then the Ieſuites, if they ſay true, or as they would ſometimes, for a deuice make people beleeue they do. So as it cannot be otherwiſe (which this worthy Cardinall well noted in them) but that the Ieſuites in all their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, plots and pretences (ſhadowed ouer with neuer ſo condenſate a bright colour of religious zeale) aime at a higher marke in the apple of the worlds eye: then to do all things <hi>gratis,</hi> and of poore pure deuotion, charitie, humilitie, obedience, and I cannot tell how many Academicall vertues and perfections, which muſt (forſooth) be attributed vnto theſe perfect ſtates-men and religious illuminates. For how is it poſſible if they had any good, religious, Catholike or bare Chriſtian meaning with them, that they ſhould make exceptions of perſons, in admitting none into their company or ſociety, but ſuch as either by his wit, wealth, birth, or other meanes, may bring ſome gaine, helpe and meanes to their further prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and aduancement here on earth.</p>

It is flat ſingularitie, innouation, and abſurdity of your idle braines, without any authoritie either of the Catholike Church, or Scripture for you: to ſingle out any one ſoule in this ſort. Did our Sauiour teach, did his Apoſtles practiſe, did the Church deliuer by tradition vnto you, that you might or ought to admit none but wiſe: but wealthy: but of great parentage, or buſie headed bodies into your ſociety? Was heauen made, did Chriſt ſuffer his bitter death and paſſion: left he an order in his Church, that none ſhould be admitted into a ſtate of perfection, but either rich folkes, or Philoſophers, or Princes (for howſoeuer you teach to the contrarie openly, yet your practiſe ſheweth it to be your meaning priuatly.) No, no: (ſeditious <hi>Choriſtes, Dathanians</hi> and <hi>Abironiſtes</hi>) there is no ſuch text of Scripture, nor Cannon of Apoſtle, nor Decree of ecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Synode, nor Tradition of the Church, nor conſent of Doctors, nor rule nor principle, nor any the leaſt clauſe in the foundation of your ſociety, or confirmation of the ſame by the Apoſtolicall <hi>Romane</hi> Sea: that makes for you in this point of ſingularity, election and choice.</p>

The firſt is faith, as the gate without which none can enter into Gods houſe, either here militant on earth, or triumphant in heauen: for <hi>accedentem ad Deum oportet credere, &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond is charitie: as the way by which poore ſinners walke in their iourney towards heauen: which whoſoeuer wants, if he haue faith able to remoue mountaines, giue all he hath to the poore, and his body to the fire: yet without charitie ſhall he neuer
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20192:75"/> come there, <hi>Si charitatem non habuero, nihil ſum.</hi> The third is hope, as the finiall end of our entrance into the Church of God, and cauſe of our progreſſe in a vertuous courſe of life therein: which is to be partakers of a glorious reſurrection, and to enioy eternall bleſſedneſſe: for if it were not in hope of this <hi>miſerabiliores eſſemus omnibus hominibus.</hi> Of theſe three the Apoſtle ſayth <hi>manent tria haec fides ſpes charitas: maior autem horum est charitas:</hi> as much to ſay as this: it is hope that moues vs to trot and trudge, and take ſuch paines to come to heauen: it is faith that openeth the way thither, without which God can neuer be pleaſed: but cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is the forme and cauſe efficient, and therefore as a golden meane and chiefe of three, ſhe giues the Crowne to King and Queene: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in heauen for euermore.</p>

If all theſe three be required in one perſon (as commonly you Ieſuites hunt after ſuch buckes of the firſt head but yet with a veluet pawme) then alas for woe: how ſhall euer thoſe come in heauen, that haue neither qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of body to get it, nor gift of mind to gaine it, nor quillet of land to buy it, nor quidditie of wit to keepe it? No, no, proud Phariſees you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: <hi>Non eſt perſonarum exceptio coram Deo:</hi> neither hath he left the kingdome of heauen to be giuen to one more then to another, for any humane gift or qualitie in them. <hi>Sed qui poteſt capere capiat.</hi> It is layd open to all alike, and onely the trueſt louers carrie away the greateſt trophees: and charitable emulation (who may loue their Lord God moſt deerely) that is the onely ſpirituall ſtrife for heauen, amongſt all thoſe that euer come thither: <hi>regnum caelorum vim patitur &amp; violenti rapiunt illud.</hi> It is neither gotten by poyſe of words, by pregnancie of wit, by bragge of birth, by boaſt of wealth: by dint of ſword, or pricke of ſpeare.

                  <p>Not the pooreſt begger, nor ſimpleſt ſoule, nor baſeſt body that liues, but hath the touch of loue and affections, as naturally inſerted in his will: as hath the greateſt Monarch vnder heauen: and therefore all alike neare to God by creation, by redemption, by natures incline in euery one: Loue diuine (which we call charity) making no diſtinction of perſons, but by the meaſure of their affections. And ſo true it is <hi>dimiſſa ſunt ei peccata multa quoniam dilexit multum. Et qui plus diligit, ei plus dimittitur.</hi> Hereupon riſeth the common opinion to carry ſenſe with it: that poore, that ſimple, that meane, that ignorant men and women, go ſooner to heauen, then rich, then noble, then learned, then ſuch wiſe wiſards as you Ieſuites are. The reaſon whereof can be none other then this: For that theſe three vertues, faith, hope and charity being the gifts of God, and not to be gotten by <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> wit, nor <hi>Caeſars</hi> might, nor <hi>Creſus</hi> his wealth: the ſimple mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and poorer ſort, ſuffer God Almighty ordinarily to worke more freely, firmely, &amp; ſweetly in their harts (<hi>vtpote ſuauiter diſponens omnia,</hi> abundantly ſupplying their other defects) then in theirs, who thinking themſelues to be iolly fellowes, will contend by reaſon or otherwiſe with the giuer of all things: and ſo ſtriue to giue God checke mate, or to be halfe with him in their proud <hi>Nemrodian</hi> aſpires. Which is the cauſe that they often ſuffer a Luciferian fall: which other that ſeeke not to clime ſo high are free from. And for this cauſe it is, and hath euer bene in vſe (ſaue amongſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20192:76"/> you Ieſuits) that thoſe who did take themſelues to a religious courſe of life, did it in <hi>ſimplicitate cordis,</hi> voiding their thoughts of all promotions, popular applauſe, or other gaine, to accrue vnto them thereby.</p>
                  <p>Therefore do I conclude, that by all probable coniecture, there is not one amongſt a hundreth that goes to be a Ieſuit, that hath any true religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in him: but a proud, ambicious, vaine glorious, aſpiring mind. For what hath pouerty to do with riches? what, contempt of the world with worldly honours? what an abiect life, with birth and parentage? what, originall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, with ſinfull policy? what, ſolitarineſſe with panigeries of praiſes? what, mortification with popular applauſes? what, religious renunciation, with fame and renowne? what, perfect humility, with vaunting arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? what Cels and Cloiſters, with Courts and Pallaces? what, true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, with controlement of Princes? what, Monaſticall exerciſe, with Eccleſiaſticall: nay with temporall, mechanicall, mundane affaires? Is this your profeſſion of ſo high perfection? O that all ſtates in Chriſtendome would follow Cardinall <hi>Boroneus</hi> his example, either in baniſhing of you quite out of Europe, or at leaſt in pulling in your hornes, vntill you were brought into ſome better order, moderation, &amp; knowledge of your ſelues. For my part I confeſſe vnto you, that as I haue hitherto alwayes prayed and enioyned others to do the like, for peace, vnity, and concord betwixt you and the ſeculars: ſo ſhall it be my continuall prayer hereafter: that (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer other ſtates do, it may pleaſe God of his mercy to looke vpon our afflicted countrey, and to moue the hart of his Holineſſe, to call you out from amongſt vs here, vntill your inſolency be abated: and withall to remoue all Ieſuites for euer out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge at <hi>Rome:</hi> where there are other manner of practiſes then were euer attempted by any Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit in the territories of <hi>Millan,</hi> nay or I thinke in the Chriſtian world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: many reuerend, vertuous ſecular Prieſts being ſent home into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> loaden till their backes crackt with the Ieſuits calumniations and ſlanders: and none but ſuch as will be Ieſuiticall wholly, and not perfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, may find any fauour there.

                  <p>I Told you before if you remember, that they haue made a Puritanian di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate in their high Councell of Reformation for <hi>England:</hi> wherein amongſt other things a ſtatute is made for abrogation of all Epiſcopall dignity, and that iuſt like to the Puritanian or the <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrightian,</hi> or the <hi>Browniſtian,</hi> or the <hi>Geneuian,</hi> or the <hi>Gehenian</hi> platforme: there ſhall a new order or gouernement be brought into the Church, whoſe gouernors ſhall conſiſt of ſixe ſeniors or elders (in the congregation of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> or Dutch Peeres, or what you will call them:) whereof the ſeculars ſhall be as it were Chaplins to the Ieſuits, as <hi>Pater Rector</hi> and <hi>Pater mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> that is father <hi>Parſons</hi> and his miniſter. So as cleare it is, that the Ieſuites will alwayes haue ſome ſeculars amongſt them, either to vſe as aſſes to lay their load vpon (if any thing happen amiſſe amongſt them:) or elſe as <hi>Iebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> in this land of promiſe (made vnto them by the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as they report) left for theſe choice people of God to worke vpon. But howſoeuer it happen, I find no mention made in that ſtatute, whether the ſeculars muſt be aliens and ſtrangers, or of a natiue brood: that ſhall be put to theſe meane offices. For it were an indecent thing, that the great fathers ſhould deſiſt from preaching, dealing with Princes and high affaires <hi>&amp; miniſtrare menſis.</hi> No fie, God forbid their honours ſhould ſo baſely be ſtained: and the matter I thinke is diſputable, whether they ſhall be all <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or all <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or of a mixt hotch potch of all, or ſo many ſundry nations. But I thinke ſure the laſt: for it were no pollicy to haue them all of one nation, but rather like the <hi>Turkes Baſſaes,</hi> and <hi>Ianiſſaries</hi> of <hi>omnium gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> So that if any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts be admitted to that ſeruile dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, it is very like to be the Archprieſt (were it not that more probable it is that father <hi>Parſons</hi> will haue about with him for old done deedes) or Doctor <hi>Worthington,</hi> or Doctor <hi>Turner,</hi> or ſome hote ſpurre of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, or ſuch one or other, as may be fitteſt to ſerue their turne for the time. Mary for any of our nation to be in the higheſt roomes ſaue onely Ieſuites, that is not a thing to be looked for, as too arrogant a part for any to thinke of it. Yea Doctor <hi>Allane</hi> troubled them much with thought and care, where to haue beſtowed that ſilly ſimple man, if the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:20192:77"/> had preuailed in the yeare 88.

                  <p>THey do queſtionleſſe intend it: for the preferment of ſome, for a while at the firſt: otherwiſe they had no pollicy in them (for I doubt not of their ingratitude further then to ſerue their turnes withall.)

                  <p>NOw when you talke of ſocieties, you make me remember the new buildings in <hi>Edenborough</hi> called the Colledge or ſociety houſe of the City: where the Puritanes haue many prety orders, obſeruations, and rules ſet downe amongſt them for gouernement, not much vnlike the orders of the Ieſuits ſociety.

                  <p>THey are wholly ſicke of the faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in theſe their ſeditious factions. But yet for faſhions ſake, they haue a new faſhion, by which is faſhioned all their faſhions, follies and deceits: and that is to haue a new tricke of a viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary poſt or current of time to gaine time withall, in keeping Nobles, State and all the people in ſuſpence of euents, vntil they haue what they looke for. And this is a practiſe of very high importance. I cannot tell what to ſay to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they haue ſo many <hi>Machiuilean</hi> deuiſes, as euerie plot &amp; drift ſeemeth to be an infallible rule of falſhood, and a principle in chiefe, whereby father <hi>Parſons</hi> &amp; his adherents do ſo ſquare their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as neuer a Prince in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, nor any man liuing can tell where to find them, or how to trace or truſt them: they are ſo vncertaine, &amp; ſo full of formes, faſhions, turnings &amp; doublings, as neuer wild March hare had moe. For they hold out, only as time ſerueth: now filling all their ſailes, &amp; then launching forth with a faire gale of wind: &amp; againe within a ken caſting anchor, with a breath in a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible calme: &amp; yet preſently after with a whirle-wind for another purpoſe, haile in the bol, and hoyſt vp ſaile, pumpe amaine, and caſt all vpon the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord but tooke for a time. Time the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being the length, change the breadth, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity the rule they ſquare by: I can iudge none otherwiſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any one, then as of their like meaning in other practiſes: which is, that if they haue any vſe of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (who yet perhaps is not altogether for their purpoſe in al things) they make faire weather with him for the time, and afterward, leſt he ſhold expect ſome extraordinarie fauor or benefit at their hands, they haue twenty dog-trickes, new waies &amp; deuiſes by detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting (which by their <hi>maxime</hi> is called gaining or winning of time) how to ſhake him off verie Ieſuitically, and he neuer the wiſer of it. Of this principle obſerued amongſt the Ieſuits for winning of time, father <hi>Cryton</hi> a <hi>Scot.</hi> Ieſuit
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20192:80"/> (I thinke ouerſlipping himſelfe at vnawares in his words) told the Lord <hi>Dacre,</hi> being then in <hi>Spaine</hi> (put in hope of great matters, but impatient in delayes) that it was their manner, when they had one of his account and calling, that although they could not, or at leaſt would not performe what they promiſed, or put the party in hope of: yet was it in pollicy for them to draw him on, without giuing him any reſolute anſwer to the contrary: as the onely way to gaine time: ſo that by keeping him there, put off with lingring hope in delayes, they might the eaſier either act ſome other action by him to ſerue their turns withall (which vpon the ſudden could not be in readineſſe to be enterpriſed) or elſe preuent ſome inconuenience, which might happen vnto them by his preſent departure or abſence in another place. Notwithſtanding the Lord <hi>Dacre</hi> hauing had ſufficient warning giuen him before, aſwell by the Noble Dutches of <hi>Feria,</hi> halfe ſiſter to Sir <hi>Robert Dormer,</hi> nephew to the ſayd Lord by mariage (who hath often ſhewed a true naturall <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies heart, euen liuing in a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſoile, againſt theſe vnnaturall <hi>Parſonian</hi> practiſes) as alſo by the ſaid father <hi>Criton</hi> (who bid his Lordſhip in effect looke for none other, then to haue father <hi>Parſons</hi> his mortall enemie for euer: by reaſon of his refuſall to fauour or further the title of the Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> and for his free and liberall ſpeech on the behalfe of his Prince and countrey againſt all forraine pretenders, &amp;c.) expected no leſſe, as ſince he hath found, then moſt iniurious calumniations againſt him euerie where. Yet vſed <hi>Parſons</hi> often dalliance with his Lordſhip, either to make him breake off friendſhip ſome with his deareſt friends: or elſe to feed him with hopes or gifts, to co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lour other guiles, or to remoue ſome old ſtooles to make him breake his ſhinnes vpon them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It was a pretie ieſt, to heare how they cogd with maiſter <hi>Cecill</hi> after he had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his protection here in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; how by gaining time of putting him off with hope of preſent parley this day &amp; that day, and at ſuch a place now, &amp; then at another, they made him trudge &amp; courſe both tide, Thames and time with croſſe encounters, vntill he was weary of it. But of all the reſt, they vſed a faithfull ſeruant of theirs, Doctor <hi>Barret</hi> preſident at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> moſt vnthankfully: which becauſe it is the very Anatomy of all the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits baſe gained time, I will ſet it out word for word as it is in the originall, wherein I found it: yet very briefly there deliuered.</p>
                  <p>This maiſter <hi>Barret</hi> was for a long time one of the Ieſuits chiefe darlings, and a ſpeciall inſtrument to many purpoſes: whom they requited in the end with all manner of diſguſts and diſgraces, euen to his laſt breath. For being ſent for vp to <hi>Rome</hi> about the breach of the ſtudents with the Ieſuits: Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Tolet</hi> hoping he would haue taken part with the ſeculars, intended to haue made him Rector there, and to haue caſt out all the Ieſuites as he did caſt out ſixe of them. But Maiſter <hi>Barret</hi> contrarie to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals expectation, became wholly Ieſuited, and did what he could in fauor
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20192:80"/> of them againſt the ſtudents. Whereupon Cardinall <hi>Tolet</hi> reiected him as an vnworthy man. The Ieſuits afterwards ſent him downe to <hi>Doway</hi> to his old charge: and father <hi>Parſons</hi> the archcouſiner craftily made him purchaſe a houſe which coſt 1200. crownes, and withall ſtopt at <hi>Rome</hi> the Popes penſion for the Colledge the ſpace of two yeares. By theſe occaſions Doctor <hi>Barret</hi> in behalfe of the Colledge fell in debt 3000. crownes: the Ieſuits all this while keeping from him the annuall penſions. With this the Doctor at length being moued, ſending to <hi>Rome</hi> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine and require the mony: gentle father <hi>Parſons</hi> went to the Pope, and accuſed him of exceſſe and euill husbandry, in diſpoſing the Popes Penſions. And ſo by this meanes through gaine of time, ſuffering the houſe to fall in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, father <hi>Parſons</hi> gained two commodities thereby: one was thereupon to ſend into <hi>England</hi> for collections to be made: and that none ſhould come ouer vnto <hi>Doway</hi> without twenty pounds or a good large ſum in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by reaſon of the great want that the Colledge was in: another, that hereupon through tract of time, he got aduantage of the poore Preſident, as though the Colledge had decaied through his default: and ſo intended vpon that occaſion to haue caſt him out, and haue thruſt in Ieſuits in his place, ſauing that his death preuented it. But other matters falling out here in <hi>England</hi> contrarie to their expectation about their Atchpresbiter: it was thought neceſſarie for gaining of time a while longer, not as yet to place there the Ieſuits, but one Doctor <hi>Worthington</hi> for a time to be a ſtickler to gaine time by for them.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Ieſuits axiome of winning, redeeming or gaining of time is nothing elſe in effect, then to runne withall times, in altering their poſitions, by three generall rules or propoſitions (vſed now one way and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another as a <hi>medius terminus</hi> for euery doubtfull argument) one is <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora mutantur: ergo nos mutamur in illis:</hi> Another is: <hi>omnia pro tempore: er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go nihil pro veritate.</hi> The laſt is: <hi>diuide &amp; imperia</hi> at all times, ſo as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the ſpoile being in thine owne hands, thou mayſt make it ſerue thy turne, to win by time thy deſires. The practiſe of which ground is in no Ieſuites affaire ſo manifeſt, as in this verie point and platforme for their <hi>Engliſh</hi> gouernement: labouring to outward ſhew to ſet vp now one, then another: intending it for none at all in very deed: as by conferring of one thing with another, may be eaſilie diſcouered in their practiſes. For it is not vnknowne to all the Chriſtian world (as I verily thinke) that in <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Flaunders</hi> and euery where: but eſpecially here in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> they labour to ſtirre vp all men, vnder colour of religion and zealous deſire in them, of our countries conuerſion: againſt our Soueraigne, the preſent State, and aboue all againſt the ſeculars, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be fautors of heretikes, furtherers of heretikes titles to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Crowne, and a faction (forſooth) we muſt be tearmed, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Montebankes, that haue put this phraſe into ignorant peoples
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20192:81"/> heads, that when they talke of any that is oppoſite to theſe ſeditious Ieſuits damnable courſes, they muſt ſay: ô, he is one of the faction: when like a company of aſſes, if they knew what a faction meant, they might eaſily diſcerne that theſe their new maiſters did ride them (like fooles, as they are) and made them become a moſt ſeditious, infamous, pragmaticall, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, diabolicall faction, to ſet vp and defend a baſtardly fellow in all his miſchieuous plots and deuiſes: and that the ſeculars are of no faction at all: vnleſſe they will call it a faction to ioyne againſt theſe vſurpers with the whole Church of God: and ſo may they (as probably like right heretikes, they will do ſo one day) ſay that all Catholike nations throughout Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, are of the faction: there being no Catholike countrey, people, or nation in the world this day, but doth diſlike of them, and is againſt their wicked proceedings: or elſe for ſpeaking in defence of their Prince and countrey, I meane in matters of gouernement, ſucceſſion, and ſtate affaires, clearly abſtracted from points of faith and religion: and then and therein alſo, if they ſay the ſeculars are of the faction, they may aſwell ſay, that her Maieſtie and honorable Counſell, and in few, all that are exempted from trayterous attempts and conſpiracies, either within or without the land, are ſo. And then by conſequent, all are of the faction throughout the world, that will not yeeld to a Ieſuiticall ſupremacy in the ſtate Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, and to their Monarchy in a ſtate temporall: and in both, to make father <hi>Parſons</hi> a king Cardinall.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this matter it is worthy the noting, to ſee how this <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> Ieſuit <hi>Parſons,</hi> hath banded off and on with time, like a <hi>Protheus.</hi> His and his fautors oſtentation in outward ſhew, is wholy for religion, and that they do moſt earneſtly deſire the conuerſion of their countrey, and of ſuch and ſuch particular perſons by name: yea they would (I marry would they) all follow, and proſecute the king of <hi>Scots</hi> title, if he would become Catholike: but if not, they would all dye one after another againſt him. And yet contrary to this oſtentation made, both in a letter of father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to the Marques <hi>Huntley</hi> (whom they account to be a ſpeciall fautor of their faction) as alſo contrarie to ſundrie other of their writings, ſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules and paſſages, they haue dealt both priuatly and openly to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. In ſomuch that (omitting particular practiſes, as with the late Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to whom father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſent a Ieſuite Prieſt, to haue had him to take a penſion of the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> priuatly, for aduancement of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignements, neuer mentioning any Religion to him, off or on: but be as he be would: and ſo with others hath he dealt beſides) the viper ſhewed his malice moſt in the treatie of peace, betwixt the kings of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi> For at that time there was a rumour runne abroad, that the Queene of <hi>England</hi> would enter into that league, and ſo graunt a tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religion. But this, father <hi>Parſons</hi> vtterly diſliked of: ſaying, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would haue all or none: that they would admit of no conditions.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20192:81"/> His reaſon was this: becauſe (quoth he) a tolleration would make the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes of <hi>England</hi> dull and without ſpirit, &amp;c. But the reaſon indeed was this (and in good faith when I firſt did ſee the Articles here drawne out in <hi>England</hi> of the conditions for peace, before euer any newes came of this great Statiſts cenſure) I ſayd to a very friend of mine: that it would coſt the Ieſuits a brace of a thouſand pounds to ſtop it: for that it ſtood not with father <hi>Parſons</hi> platforme to haue any relaxation of perſecution in <hi>England,</hi> ſo long as either her Maieſtie liued, or yet after, vntill he were ready to come with Montioy Saint <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> for the <hi>Britons</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, becauſe a tolleration for religion would breed theſe inconueniences (all making againſt him and his faction.) Firſt, he could not then haue any colour to ſet out bookes, or anticke ſhewes (as he hath) or to blaze it abroad in all nations, how cruell, tyrannicall, and inhumane the perſecution of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes is in <hi>England.</hi> Secondly, he could no longer after haue blowne the infamous blaſts that courſe both ſea and land, he affirming <hi>England</hi> to be the nurcery of faction, ſedition, and of all miſchiefe wrought throughout the world, ſetting all Princes, Monarches and States together by the eares, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in league with one to make warre againſt another, and maintaining of rebels againſt their Soueraignes. Thirdly, he could not by al likelihood haue had any Catholike Prince or other in Chriſtendome to haue banded on his ſide. For with what colour could either <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Auſtria,</hi> or any Catholike Prince haue inuaded <hi>England,</hi> if Catholikes might liue here as freely as they did in <hi>France,</hi> or as the <hi>Hugonites</hi> do now liue there, and the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Chriſtians in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and the <hi>Mahumetanes</hi> in <hi>Tartary,</hi> &amp; the Pagans in <hi>Preſbiter Iohns</hi> dominions. Fourthly, he could neuer after haue gone forward with this platforme for aſpiring to the Monarchy. For whereas now all Catholikes muſt depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon the Archprieſt, &amp; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt vpon father <hi>Garnet,</hi> &amp; <hi>Garnet</hi> vpon <hi>Parſons,</hi> &amp; <hi>Parſons</hi> vpon the diuel, (the author of all rebellious conſpiracies, treaſons, murthers, diſobedience, hereſies, &amp; all ſuch other diabolicall &amp; bloudy deſignements, as this wicked Ieſuit hath hitherto deuiſed) then and in that caſe this dependency had bin vtterly voide. For we ſhould haue had Catholike Biſhops as Suffragans or ſuch like, that might haue giuen holy orders, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated holy oiles, miniſtred the Sacrament of Confirmation, exerciſed their Epiſcopall authority in all things neceſſary, priuatly: as it was in the Apoſtles time and Primitiue Church, without either any the leaſt inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance or perturbance of the ſtate, or preſent incumbents (the Biſhops &amp; Archbiſhops that now are) or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of any ſeditious Ieſuit, or other factious perſon to come within the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Fiftly, his malitious deuiſes, &amp; cruel hard hart towards al Catholiks had her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bin diſcouered: as neuer able hereafter to haue ſtirred vp her Maieſty, or incenſed her honorable Counſell againſt all her loyall and moſt dutifull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, for his treacheries, treaſons &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracies. Becauſe al in that caſe wold haue bin ready to haue reuealed the leaſt thought of any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federacy againſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20192:82"/> her royall perſon, kingdome and ſtate. Sixtly, his baits had bene worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for enticing and alluring of any ſubiect to rebellion (either for the time preſent, or to come: becauſe a league being once made with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> nation: all Catholikes of <hi>England</hi> being withall naturally incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to loue and loyalty of and to their Prince and countrey, all promiſes or hopes of preferment vnder forreine Princes, would haue bin and ſeemed hatefull, ridiculous and ſenſleſſe vnto them. No nation vnder heauen affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greater honors, comforts and content then <hi>England,</hi> and our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes both are able &amp; do affoord to the inhabitants that liue in grace and fauor: as in this caſe <hi>(vtcunque)</hi> the afflicted Catholikes ſhould. Seuenthly, this tolleration or liberty of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, wold quite haue cut off two bloudy hopes, which <hi>Parſons</hi> hath in al his practiſes: to wit, aſwel the inda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gering of her Maieſties royall perſon, as alſo the fauoring, furthering, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſenting, or any way ſeeking directly or indirectly the aduancement of any one competitor more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another: otherwiſe then they ſhold haue perceiued her Highneſſe &amp; the preſent ſtate to haue fauored and like of. For howſoeuer the ſeculars, &amp; many other ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Catholiks do deteſt to death the ſaid practiſes, &amp; wold be as ready as any to dye at her Maieſties feete, in defence of her royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and (euen in the afflicted ſtate they liue in) to reueale any ſuch vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and monſtrous conſpiracies: yet all are not of that humor (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as good Catholikes and loyall ſubiects in another ſenſe as the former are) in that knowing themſelues moſt innocent of all ſtate-medlings, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes whatſoeuer, they are notwithſtanding nothing for that more fauored. And therefore nature inclining all men liuing to ſeeke for eaſe, quiet, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie &amp; auoidance of troubles, dangers, afflictions &amp; miſeries: although they abhor, &amp; would neuer to death be actors in ſuch conſpiracies: yet their wits being occupied with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits of the premiſes, makes many one wiſh in their heart for a change: neuer thinking, conſidering nor regarding which way, nor by what meanes ſoeuer. And then when this generall deſire of liuing quiet &amp; free in all, is ſorted with an inconſiderate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit in many, a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t motion of reuenge working in ſome, makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ready to attempt what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate act ſoeuer, <hi>ad iniuſtam vexationem redimendam.</hi> And ſo to folow any abettor, complottor, pretendor or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpirator. Which father <hi>Parſons</hi> wel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp; how that by liberty of conſcience, all ſuch conceits would vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, &amp; ſo fruſtrate his hope for euer, egging, ſuggeſting, or ſetting on any euen to haue the leaſt wiſh or thought of alteration or change: no maruell though he cannot abide to heare of any league or liberty. Eightly, his chiefe hope being to procure a new formall excommunication againſt all that ſhal not ioyne with <hi>Spaine,</hi> or the Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> when bloudy <hi>Bellona</hi> ſhal once hang forth her ſlag of defiance within an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ken in the ſtreamers of her menaces: by this foreſayd liberty granted, his butcherie, ſacriligious and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular hope, were not onely fruſtrate in this, but alſo all former excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, ſuſpenſions and Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, that haue earſt

Well, it hath bene an ordinarie matter, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notorious hereſie did ariſe, that ſundrie contraries out of the ſame did ſpring: and ſo I feare it will proue betwixt the Puritane Ieſuites, and the Puritane Miniſters, vnleſſe ſome order be taken for them both in time, leſt they winne ſo much time, as it will be paſt time to correct them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time hereafter.

O good Lord yea a Catholike he muſt be: ſo her Maieſtie were depoſed he careth not by whom, but yet muſt make ſhew, that it muſt be by aduancing ſome Catholike, otherwiſe he could haue no colour of wiſhing for it: and much leſſe any meanes either to exaſperate her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and the preſent State againſt Catholikes, or yet to ſtirre vp Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes with deſire to redeeme themſelues out of the heauie perſecutions laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. For as he dealt firſt by his Agents with the Earle of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> (and yet the ſaid Earle was no Catholike) ſo at an other time he writ a diſcourſe, ſent it into <hi>England,</hi> and it cauſed to be publiſhed to many of the beſt Catholikes here: which was, that he would wiſh, and did by thoſe preſents aduiſe them, when the commoditie ſerued, that they ſhould make an election of ſome principal Noble (and at laſt with much ado came out this word, Catholike) to be their King. And all this was but a point of dalliance to gaine time withall. And ſtill when no pretender nor people wil be ſo madde as to follow his deſignements, then hath he euer his recourſe

                  <p>And thus the caſe is cleare in anſwer to the interrogatorie, that abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Ieſuits ſeeke the conuerſion of no one of the bloud Royall, but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally onely, and for winning of time, they ſeeke for the conuerſion of now one, and then another, as may for the time make moſt for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

                  <p>THey intend it only conditionally, ſubordinately, and legatiuely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another. For it were no pollicie by their principles to haue any one abſolute Monarch or Soueraigne in <hi>eſſe</hi> ouer all <hi>England,</hi> to rule ouer them too: no more then it were to haue had an Archprieſt that ſhould haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, and haue bene head ouer the Ieſuits as well as the ſeculars. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they got ſuch a fellow for the nonce to be Archprieſt, as both they might gouerne as they liſt themſelues, and make him fare like a Turke, tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker or madde man at their pleaſure, to torment poore ſoules, the ignorant deuout laitie with ſcruples: the wiſer ſort with infamous libels, ſchedules, gallings, letters and meſſages of ſlaunders: and all both men and women, cleargie and laitie, with threats, thunderings and feares, that wold not obey
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20192:84"/> a paltrey Ieſuite, and to be readie to crouch, bow, and kneele at an inch, a nod or a frowne to theſe new Phariſes: ſo of very like qualitie, condition, and order muſt be their Viceroy and his gouernement. For all this banding on the Archprieſts behalf, was only (you ſee) thoſe vile patches hypocriſie: vnder pretence of a legatiue and ſubordinate power and authoritie vnder his Holineſſe, whom they moſt abuſiuely, impudently, and (in the intended platforme) ſcoffingly make the maske, cloud and cloake, vnder which they hide the neuer heard of more impietie. And like a company of ſwaggerers, ruffians, or bragging braggats of <hi>Toledo,</hi> they take vpon them to defend the Archprieſt in all his actions, vnder colour of obedience: with, ô I will, yea that I will ſtand to death in defence of this due obedience, to the See of his Holineſſe, (for to defend him, ſay they, is to defend the Pope himſelfe:) which might carie ſome ſenſe, if they acknowledged him alſo to be their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior. But ſeeing they acknowledge no ſuch matter, nay quite contrarie, that he ſtands at their deuotion, and is but like an Ape, a Parrot, or a Vice in a play, to prate what is prompted or ſuggeſted vnto him: or like an axe, a ſaw, a ſword, or other dead inſtrument that moues and workes all things, <hi>intentione rationalis agentis,</hi> (for he hath no wit nor diſcretion to do any thing, as it ſeemeth, but as their Prouinciall inſtructs him) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what is this elſe to ſay, vz. whoſoeuer is diſobedient to the Archprieſt is diſobedient to the Pope: then to maintaine that, whoſoeuer is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to a Ieſuite in any thing, <hi>reus est</hi> of diſobedience vnto the Pope in all things: for he that offends in one, offends in all. And ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in this ſubordinate authoritie, theſe corollaries follow one vpon another in this manner: the Archprieſt muſt rule all other Prieſts: the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites muſt rule the Archprieſt: the Pope muſt appoint whom, and as they liſt: the diſobedience to the partie appointed muſt be holden for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Holineſſe: the action goeth vnder the name of Schiſme and irregularitie: the Court of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>terminer,</hi> muſt be in the Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries vnder Archduke <hi>Albert:</hi> the Commiſſioners, Iurie and Iudges muſt be the Ieſuites: the apeale to the Pope from them muſt be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuſpenſion and loſſe of all faculties and authoritie: and ſo <hi>Parſons</hi> as <hi>ſummus Pontifex,</hi> or Iudge Paramount on earth, vnder the Diuell in hell: muſt denounce the ſentence following, out from his infernall ſeate.</p>

                  <p>All theſe lawes, ſtatutes and acts (with prouiſoes) thus enacted: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the ſeculars contemptuouſly, haue violated, infringed and broken, the very marrow, center and quinteſſence of their contempt, accrewing to the preiudice of the holy ſocietie, and therein to Father <hi>Parſons</hi> in chiefe, it ſtood his Prouinciall <hi>Garnet</hi> vpon, to lay about him on the behalf of <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> to make his cauſe and quarrell his owne: and this to be outwardly in ſhew <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, his Holineſſe the Pope of <hi>Romes,</hi> in managing and menacing: and inwardly in intention, to be <hi>Parſons</hi> that baſtardly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of hell: his in the platforme, plotcaſtings and practiſes. And ſo for all the world neuer imagine nor dreame of any kind of temporall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a Puritane Ieſuit, to be otherwiſe intended: then as a Puritane Miniſter ſaid in <hi>Edenborough, God and the Kirke againſt the King and his Councell: and outher, ney King or ney Minister in Scotland.</hi> As much to ſay, and as <hi>Knoxe</hi> that ſeditious traitor did write to her Maieſtie: that thoſe Princes who will not ſubiect themſelues to their infernall and damnable diſcipline, yea and ſubmit themſelues to be ruled by the Puritanian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, might iuſtly and ſhold be depoſed and depriued both of Crown, gouernement and life at their pleaſure. Wherein you may pleaſe to note by the way, that the Puritanian Miniſters made the Goſpell, and the blacke Kirke of <hi>Scotland,</hi> their pretence for aduauncing ſuch a man to the Crowne, as ſhould wholly ſubiect himſelfe, and ſweare and ſubſcribe to the defence of their doctrine.

Whereupon it is by demonſtration manifeſt, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and cauſe of his election and inſtitution, proceeded all wholly from the Ieſuits: &amp; was the moſt vile, preſumptuous and iniurious part of <hi>Parſons</hi> that euer was heard of ſince the world began: as by all the bookes that are, and will be ſet out againſt that Atheall ſtratagemitor, will at large appeare. Onely for the preſent this Article is neceſſarie to be propoſed and anſwered for ſatisfying of the ignorant multitude: amongſt whom theſe couſining mates the Ieſuits make it to be giuen out, as though the Archprieſt were the head ouer all Catholikes both Clergie and laitie, ſpirituall and temporall, ſecular and religious: which is nothing elſe but a cogging de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in them to build thereupon theſe falſe aſſertions following for blinding and deluding of the ſimple, ſcil. Firſt, that now all is well we hauing an Archprieſt, that as our head is an indifferent man for all, aſwell ſeculars as Ieſuits. Secondly, that the ſeculars are onely thoſe that make ſedition and ſtrife, not liuing orderly as they ſhould vnder obedience to the Archprieſt their ſuperior. Thirdy, that the Ieſuites liue contented and quiet vnder his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20192:86"/> gouernement, though he be a ſecular Prieſt onely for obedience. Fourthly, that there being no difference betwixt the ſeculars and Ieſuits in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts authority, he being equally appointed ouer them both, it is a bad ſigne in the ſeculars that ſhould ſeeme to find fault with his gouernement more then the other. Fiftly, that the ſeculars ſhew no religion in them, but liue as prophane ſchiſmatikes, in withdrawing their obedience from their ſuperiour more then the Ieſuits do. Sixtly, that the Ieſuits ſhew themſelues to be maruellous zealous, wiſe, learned &amp; religious: in ſtanding to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, as they do againſt the ſeculars. Seuenthly, that no good or ſound Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike would euer haue made any queſtion of his authoritie: now that it is gotten, though he were partiall to one more then another. Eightly, that an authoritie being once granted, how impious, vniuſt, and vnlawfull ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, yet it ought to be obeyed in al things and of all thoſe vnder it to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, without any queſtion to be made of it euer after: &amp; as vnlawfull to appeale from the one as from the other. Ninthly, that the Archprieſt may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, ſuſpend, interdict, &amp;c. when he liſt notwithſtanding the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, &amp; euen for making an appeale from him to the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the ſeculars committed a moſt horrible crime, ſinne or offence in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing: and ſhewed themſelues to be diſobedient to the catholike Church and the Pope in diſobeying the Archprieſt therein: he hauing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that there ſhould be no writing nor ſending ouer beyond the ſeas, nor meetings here, nor talke had about any ſuch matters. 11. That they are a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, vnlearned and vnreuerend company: for making no more reckning of the fathers then they do, &amp; are rightly called a factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for oppoſing them ſelues againſt ſo holy, vertuous &amp; religious men, that are their betters, and ſuperiors in all things as the Ieſuits are: who haue done ſo many good deeds as the ſaculars neuer did nor can do the like. Twelftly, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought or may come at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to receiue any Sacrament, as hauing loſt al their faculties &amp; authority by their diſobedience &amp; contempt of their ſuperior. Thirteenthly, that they haue iuſtly deſerued to be euill ſpoken of, &amp; to haue no reliefe vntill they ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; recal their names from the appeale. 14. That it were no more offence to kill one of them, then to kill a notorious perſecutor &amp; heretike. Fifteenthly, that the words Chriſt ſpoke whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, whoſoeuer will not obey the Church, let him be accounted of, as a Publica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Ethnicke &amp; infidell, did aptly agree to the ſeculars to be ſo accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of, for diſobeying the Catholike Church by their appeale &amp; other ſeditious &amp; ſlanderous libels againſt their ſuperiors. Theſe &amp; many the like falſe ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (which no Ieſuit liuing dare for his life defend) are put into peopls heads of purpoſe, to colour therwith that baſtard <hi>Pa.</hi> his impiety: wherby ſeeking to bind al vnto him with the band of obedience, he ſets all his Ieſuitical bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers here in <hi>England</hi> &amp; elſewhere on worke, like ſo many band-dogs, with bands of men, banding out his miſchieuous practiſes to bring all the whole realme bound hand and foot into bondage vnder him.</p>

                  <p>ALL three are incurred to all eſtates in the higheſt degree, ſcil. both treaſon committed againſt the Church of God, and commonwealth of this land: both a premunire incurred by auncient and recent lawes againſt ſacred Maieſtie, both, (yea, all) preiudiced, ſcil. Pope, Prince, Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth and preſent ſtate by maiſter <hi>Blackwels</hi> authoritie: as is euident by ſundrie bookes written, and to be written of euery one of theſe points in particular, and may be gathered paſſant in theſe <hi>Quodlibets</hi> here and there of all three. And firſt, for treaſon: (which in Latine we call <hi>proditio</hi> or <hi>laeſa maieſtas,</hi> and a <hi>triritor, traditor, vel proditor, vel reus leſae maieſtatis.</hi> It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies an act acted: or but onely intended againſt ſupreme Maieſtie.

It is cleare then that this inſtitutiue authoritie of <hi>Blackwels,</hi> containes in it a whole maſſe of treaſon and conſpiracie: and the like is of a premunire (made by Catholike Princes, Kings of this land, and allowed of by the Sea Apoſtolike) incurred thereby.

                  <p>IT is equally at leaſt, and may in many reſpects be iudged more preiudicial to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> King and Commonwealth, then to our Soueraigne: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inſtitutor <hi>Par.</hi> had before writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his book of Titles or ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in moſt apparant preiudice, and ignominious ſlaunder of the ſaid King,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20192:87"/> very ſawcily and rudely abaſing both his royall Maieſtie and his whole Realme: and therefore too too vile a part and an act of moſt indignitie, for him ſo officiouſly to inſtitute an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man to be in ſo great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie within his highneſſe dominions. Secondly, the <hi>Scots</hi> Catholiks had, &amp; haue yet their Biſhop of <hi>Glaſco</hi> liuing, a very reuerend Prelat: <hi>ergo</hi> a more ſawcie part to appoint ouer them a ſuperior aboue him.

Firſt, to breed commiſeration of Ieſuits. Secondly, to make Seminaries and all ſecular prieſts odious to the laitie, as iniurious detractors. Thirdly, to giue ſcope by this, to defame whom they would: (which were all that might ſeem to ſtand in their way) and this done, then ſuch defamed perſons being vnfit to gouerne, none but M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> (ſuppoſing one muſt be choſen) could be found fit euery way. A notable ſtratageme: but altogether Atheall, diabolicall, intollerable.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 That all who defend the Archprieſt, are either Ieſuits, or do liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and by them: or are now put in authoritie for them: or haue the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for money throughout <hi>England:</hi> for Catholikes to depend vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or their ſubſtitutes for the ſacraments: or liue in expectance of mountaines at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> inuaſion by their procurement. All which, none that hath ſeen and knowne the ſtate of things abroad, but may eaſily diſcerne: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all well wiſhing to their Prince and countrie, were theſe <hi>Parſonians</hi> with their Archprieſt to be reſiſted, and in no caſe euer to haue yeelded to his falſe foyſted-in authoritie.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 The expoſtulations, manages and menaces of the Ieſuits, in defence of M. <hi>Blackwels</hi> authoritie, ſhew plaine how impiouſly, phariſaically and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriouſly they haue dealt therein. Firſt, for that they had at that time nothing to ſhew, but the Cardinals authorizing of him, who was knowne to be our aduerſarie. Secondly, they neuer could bring any teſtimony, but of their owne companie to certifie ſo much, as that the Pope euer heard of this mans chooſing, or any ſuch matter: vntill they had caſt M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> and M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> in priſon, and ſo tyrannized like Turkes ouer them. Thirdly, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of a Popes Bull was vaine, that which they had being all one and the ſame, (if any thing worth) as confirmed by the Pope, and a premunire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred aſwell by the one as the other, as they haue handled it. Fourthly, their pretence of the Cardinals feare, in that he durſt not graunt it, without the Popes priuit e, is ridiculous and for babies (as <hi>Parſons</hi> counts all the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) his anſwer being ready (if called in queſtion) that he appointed <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> onely as a Prefect or ſome ſuch one amongſt a multitude to keep good order, but no further: and not that, but as he was informed, vz. that he was fitteſt to appeaſe contentions, &amp;c. Fiftly, their compariſon of the Cardinall, with a Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, &amp;c. is ſimple and impertinent: for it onely (if ſo much) holds in a Prieſt and a Iuſtice of peace, <hi>verbi gratia:</hi> the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20192:89"/> Lord Chancelor or other may appoint and make a Iuſtice of peace by his generall authoritie giuen him by the Prince: but to make a Lord Preſident, or to create an Earle, or Lord Baron by that authoritie, he cannot by any generall graunt: and therefore ſuch being neuer, or very rare heard of (as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Earle of <hi>Cheſter</hi> had authoritie to create Lord Barons, and neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nor ſince had any the like,) <hi>ergo</hi> the Cardinals authoritie to giue facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Prieſts, extends not to giue a ſupreme authoritie to any one Prieſt, more then himſelfe had, or euer was known to be in any of his predeceſſors, no not in Cardinall <hi>Allane,</hi> whom common ſence tels vs ſhould haue had ſuch authoritie in and ouer his owne countrimen, ſooner then any other here amongſt vs. Sixtly, their colour of charitie, to haue had vs yeeld for the time, vntill we had heard to the contrarie: was and is but flat hypocriſie, coggerie and malice in them, pitying of vs, to bolſter out their owne abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of vs all. For hauing by <hi>Parſons</hi> meanes (no doubt) laboured by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lyes and threats to the vttermoſt, to ſtoppe all complaints, and put in a demurre, vntill that baſtard might heare hence, and get a like catalogue of names to that which the Ieſuites got before: their conſcience then would ſtretch thoſe names or other meanes vſed for that Atheall purpoſe, to as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute a conſent and acceptance of this vſurper now, as the former did by their cogging and the couſinage vſed herein. Seuenthly, their excuſe of no ticket, nor teſtimonie from the Pope, or other whom we might truſt is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and but a ridiculous confirmation of it, which they take by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Prieſts: for euery one knowes the faculties of Prieſts are generall: <hi>ergo,</hi> need no other teſtimonie, but notice giuen by any, that there they had ſuch faculties: but this Archpresbiter is a particular thing neuer heard of before: <hi>ergo,</hi> vniuſt, vnlawfull and moſt to be ſuſpected, doubted of, reſiſted, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned, abrogated, aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 The peeuiſhneſſe, ſimplicitie and vnfitneſſe of M. <hi>Blackwell,</hi> the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, enuie and Machiauelliſme of his electors, and the ignorance, lightneſſe and euen too too blindly ouerweened affection of the <hi>mobile vulgus</hi> being duly conſidered, this Archpresbitery will be the bane of all <hi>England,</hi> if euer accepted of, and eſtabliſhed by generall conſent and applauſe. Firſt, for that his authoritie extends to all <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>(vt ait) Ireland,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny agents in them all, <hi>ergo:</hi> once confirme it, and vpſtarts the <hi>Iapon</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie. Secondly, it derogates from all prieſtly authoritie: vz. by the libertie of euery Iacke and Gill, to defame Prieſts without ſatisfaction: by calling lay men to controll ſeculars, and both to diſgrace, and heare them diſgraced: as M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> ordinarily ſpeaketh not to any ſecular Prieſt, but muſt haue ſome of the laitie to heare the caſe: by their generall maxime, that they may and do vſe laitie to defame, controll, and deiect Prieſts, they being not able to be in all places, and at all times themſelues: which they confirme by the generall examples of their free ſpeech, had of all Prieſts, Monks, Friers, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the Pope himſelfe. Thirdly, it arrogates all ſupreme authority to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20192:90"/> the Ieſuits: vz. by making it a ſinne moſt haynous, not to yeeld to them in all things or a ſigne of hereſie to thinke they may erre: or malice and looſneſſe of life, to charge them with any fault. Fourthly, it is a plaine teſtimony of no religion in the Ieſuites, but flat Atheiſme making religious pietie, but only a matter of meere pollicie, by ſending foorth trumpetters to ſound out their and <hi>Blackwels</hi> vertues: concluding thereby, neither them to be ſpoken of, nor him to be refuſed, as fitteſt of all, &amp;c. as though inherent iuſtice depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon externall ſignes of vertue. Thus once yeeld to them and their Archprieſt, and farewell all religion in <hi>England</hi> ſhortly after.</p>
                  <p n="19">19 To confirme this withall, their malice and euill meaning towards Prieſts is in nothing more plaine, then managing out that vſurpate Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt: vz. by their oſtentation of a moſt horrible ſinne to reſiſt his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: <hi>ergo</hi> we are (by their detraction) al fooles, ignorant, indiſcreet, prophane, vnlearned, conſcienceleſſe, proud, malicious, infamous detractors, &amp;c. and yet by the ſame acts, they on the contrarie are all wiſe, learned, of high pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of ſpeciall good cariage, vertuous and zealous, &amp;c: ô notable hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: the old Grammer rule is fitly applyed vnto you: ſcil. <hi>hypocrita cupit ſe videri iustus, hypocrita cupit ſe videri iustum:</hi> a Ieſuite <hi>iuſtus,</hi> muſt make a <hi>Blackwell iuſtum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20 The cauſes mouing them thus vehemently to haue vrged our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the firſt, and their now ſurceaſe from calling this vſurpate authority in queſtion, muſt needs be theſe.

                  <p n="22">22 That M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> is but a cypher for the Ieſuits, to put what figure they liſt vnto, vz. by the additions &amp; ſubſtractions, affirmations, &amp; negations, &amp;c. of the particulars of his authority: <hi>ergo</hi> part the figure, and the cipher: and the beſt is, but <hi>tittle eſt, &amp;c.</hi>

Thirdly, the authority that now his aſſiſtants haue, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>nomine non re:</hi> for they haue to do with nothing, but as informers to giue intelligence what they heare and ſee.

Fourthly, this great Iland could not then haue bene gouerned abſoultely by them, as is intended it ſhall be: by excluding all Biſhops and other authority.</p>
                  <p n="27">27 It is iuſt agreeing with the Puritanes to haue this kind of Archpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitery: and <hi>Parſons</hi> priuate rules of gouernement in his high Councell of Reformation, tend to no leſſe in morall matters: though in religion he yet braues it out, as though the moſt zealous Catholikes ſided on his ſide.</p>

                  <p n="30">30 It was intended thereby to bring all by ſolemne oath, to proſecute the Ieſuites wicked deſignements: and therefore were certaine Prieſts in <hi>Spaine</hi> of late vrged to take an oath of obedience to the Archprieſt in all things, at their comming into <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding the poore Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt ſtands ſtill at the Ieſuits deuotion, to be caſt out at their pleaſure, if he act not what they command him.</p>

                  <p>Theſe things being all matters of moſt weight (the circumſtances on all ſides conſidered) that in a world can be found, I conclude with a briefe anſwer, to the Article propoſed (after ſo many reaſons in confirmation of what I ſpeake) with that moſt famous Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris</hi> (which ſpite of their malice hath a better authoritie to define of ſuch matters then any Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit hath) deciding the caſe to be cleare: that the ſeculars committed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſchiſme nor ſinne in reſiſting, or (but onely indeed) not conſenting at the firſt to the Archprieſts authority. For to ſay troth, they reſiſted him in nothing: but onely of deſire to be ſatisfied, ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> liuing in the meane while, without willing offence giuen to him or any of his. And yet the peeuiſh felow could not be quiet to ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to winke at him, vnleſſe they either put out both their eyes, or ſtared him full in the face.

But if in ſteede of comming in ſolemne proceſſion with croſſe, booke, praiers and preaching: he ſhould come in a ſounding royall march with heralds of armes, into banners of blood diſplaied, trumpets, alarum, pikes, harquebuſe and men of armes all marſhald in rankes ſet in battell aray: then would he be the firſt man in the field armed at all points, to reſiſt him in the face with al his might and power he were able to make; and what not would he doe to ſhew himſelfe a dutifull ſubiect naturalized in an Engliſh ſoile on that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.

For let the colour, pretence and proteſtation be whatſoeuer it be may; yet for that one and the ſame perſon may come as an Apoſtle of Chriſt or knight of <hi>Mars:</hi> and that the markes for others to know him by, which of theſe two he is, are not his intentions, proteſtations, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but the ſignes and tokens he brings with him, together with the manner of his outward actions and proceedings: we iudging as men not as Gods in theſe caſes: knowing that the words (inuaſion and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile power) denotate a generall ſubuerſion, population and ouerthrow of the whole common wealth and ſtate, with ſlaughter of body, ſoule and all together, and not the conuerſion of any one: no nor preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſafetie of the already conuerted (for ſo ſaid the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> in plaine termes) <hi>ſcil.</hi> I will reſpect neither one nor other if I haue them once vnder my ſworde, for I meane to make roome, place and ſpace there for my maſter &amp;c. Neither in very deede in ſuch a caſe could he almoſt chooſe to doe otherwiſe, though he had a more compaſſionate, religious and humane hart then any Spaniard ſeemeth to haue. For how ſhould he knowe a catholike from a proteſtant in the open field, where is no time to bow nor kneele, vnleſſe it be againſt their wils. But when beſides this it is manifeſt by the Dukes ſpeeches (yea and the Ieſuits too, at ſundry times affirming the ſame (as father <hi>Southwell</hi> at Wisbiche did confeſſe no leſſe in the hearing of diuers prieſtes there priſoners) that though the inuaders might: yet would they not ſpare one catholike in England, more then a proteſtant, nor ſo much as they would ſpare the puritanes. The reaſon whereof may be this in their barbarous policie: <hi>ſcil.</hi> leaſt vnder that pretence (if ſhew of religion might ſaue their liues) all for the time becomming wholy catholikes, would be too many and too ſtrong a partie to remaine on liue, and

Therefore ſeeing that to preuent this inconuenience: the inuader (whoſoeuer) will make ſure worke (if once he got footing) without ſparing of man, woman or childe: beſides (thoſe traitors of Ieſuits or puritanes that ſhall eſcape perhaps for a time, as comming in vnder his banner to betray their natiue countrie into his hands:) I hold that man for woorſe then mad, that will runne vpon his owne death euery way: as thoſe Engliſh doe (be they of what religion or profeſſion ſoeuer) that ſhould vpon any falſe perſwaſion or feare of excommunication or otherwiſe oppoſe themſelues againſt their natiue prince and countrie. And if when no ſuch danger was of vtter ſubuerſion and deſtruction of all: yet in theſe temporall and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall cauſes, we finde: that no excommunication, ſuſpenſion or interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction did take place ſo: but that thoſe puniſhed by eccleſiaſticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, did ſtill proſecute to death, their prince and countries cauſe (were the ſaid excommunications or other eccleſiaſticall cenſure iuſtly or wrongfully inflicted, which when hot bloods are vp, is not regarded of any) as in the ſtrife betwixt prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of Fraunce and king <hi>Iohn</hi> of England, and his ſonne after him, king <hi>Henry</hi> 3. and the <hi>Baliol</hi> and <hi>Bruſe</hi> of Scotland, and ſundry other examples it may appeere euen in catholike times, when there was no religion but one: then <hi>à fortiori,</hi> in the caſe propoſed like to a <hi>Danois</hi> conqueſt, when the pretence is coloured with a religious maske, and the pretendor intendes notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a generall maſſacre of all indifferently to plant a new people there with vtter extirpation of the ancient inhabitants: there is no ſenſe, religion, nor ſigne of humanitie in that Engliſh hart that would ſo vnnaturally be deluded with ſcruples, doubts and ſophiſticall buzzes put into his head in the premiſes: as not to reſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, an other interrogatorie point or queſtion in the article propoſed is: that ſuppoſing the Ieſuits and Archprieſt had right on their ſide in the matters of contention betwixt them (as they ſeeme to make the caſe as cleere for them as the ſeculars doe on the contrarie) &amp; that thereupon they ſhould iuſtly procure an excommunication with other eccleſiaſticall cenſures to be inflicted according to the qualitie of the perſon &amp; the occaſion giuen vpon the part of the appellans and all their adherents, for their contempt, diſobedience &amp;c. formally reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing, ratifying and confirming <hi>ad amplius</hi> the ſaide Archprieſtes authoritie: whether then ought not the ſeculars and all other catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes obey and ſurceaſe from further purſuite againſt either the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites or Archprieſt or no?

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:20192:95"/> were right, iuſt, lawfull and neceſſarie on the Ieſuits part, and the quite contrarie on the ſeculars: then were the ſeculars not onely bound to obey and ſurceaſe, but alſo to cry <hi>peccauimus</hi> and ſubmit themſelues to doe ſuch penance as ſhould be inioyned them &amp;c. 2. in the caſe propoſed, although they were to ſurceaſe from purſuite of the appeale in that matter: yet were they not bound to let fall their plea on the behalfe of the Catholicke Church and common wealth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or of their owne natiue countrey in ſpeciall: for that the matters of contention betwixt the ſeculars and Ieſuits, being of two kinds: the one proper as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the iniuries &amp; wrongs done, one to the other, and the other common, as concerning the iniuries and wrongs done to the whole Church, the common wealth, the ſupreme power and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Maieſties in both ſtates: they (being inſtrumentall agents (and yet withall liue members) of the two bodies miſticall and politicall) were bound to reſpect <hi>Bonum publicum</hi> before <hi>priuatum;</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent not to deſiſt from proſecuting the appeale in thoſe caſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the intereſt is in the whole Church and commonwealth, and not in themſelues alone. 3. I ſay the ſuppoſition is but a meere metaphiſicall or rather chymericall ſuppoſall or conceite: neither doe I thinke that there is any Ieſuite in England this day, but in his owne conſcience he knowes he is in the wrong, and that the ſeculars haue the right on their ſide, as well in the particular as generall action, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent it is impoſſible: (as I ſaid in the former article) but that if euer the matter come to pleading, it will goe on the ſeculars ſide againſt them. 4. I ſay more that admit an excommunication ſhould be gotten &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured <hi>(ſuggesto mendacio)</hi> againſt them for the one cauſe or the other: yet were the excommunicated ſuſpended, &amp;c. onely <hi>propter obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam</hi> to forbeare comming at, or hauing the vſe of the Sacraments. But no further: ſo as in proſecuting their appeale, or doing of any other act for the furtherance of their cauſe, they were as free as before, from all ſinne or other offence in not obeying any charge laide, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement giuen them to the contrary. 3. A third interrogatorie point, doth ſeeme to import thus much in this article ſcz. whether an excommunication, ſuſpenſion, &amp;c. being gotten <hi>quo iure quaue iniuria,</hi> againſt the ſeculars and their adherents hanging the appeale, were it to be obeied or not, in forbearing to come at the altar or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Whereunto I anſwere. 1. That <hi>Poſt appellationem factam manis est excommunicatio,</hi> or as ſaith the gloſſe, <hi>Nemo poteſt excommunicari.</hi> 2. That admit there had beene no appeale, yet could no excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſuſpenſion &amp;c. binde them in the caſe propoſed <hi>in foro conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I ſay this neither will, neither ſhall
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20192:96"/> ſerue his turne. For if they be but trifles or wranglings,<note place="margin">A Biſhop cannot authorize his chaplein: a king his ſecretary: not the Pope his protonotary in things wherein the ſo authorized depriues the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizer of his ſuperioritie ouer him, and withall of the chiefe act of iuſtice and title of his dignity and honor belonging to his perſon or place, but muſt withal make him by that act his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, bicauſe no duals in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, kingdoms or Biſhopr ckes but all ſingles as one in one, &amp;c.</note> then haue the ſeculars the woorſt of it, being ſure to be ſharpely puniſhed when the plea ſhall come before his holineſſe: but if otherwiſe it will prooue: then <hi>videant ipſi Ieſuitae, cum ſuo Archipr.</hi> But howſoeuer, be it ſo, or be it not, yet the ſeculars affirming that it is of matters of moſt moment that euer hapned in this age: as both by theſe 10. <hi>Quodlibets</hi> and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other bookes written of this ſubiect may and will appeere: it is neither <hi>Blackwell,</hi> nor <hi>Garnet,</hi> nor <hi>Parſons,</hi> nor <hi>Lucifer,</hi> nor who is the prowdeſt of them: to face it with greateſt impudency that ſhall dare preſume to be iudge therein, or ſtoppe it from comming to his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but ſhall be noted for an Antipope at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly I ſay further, that ſuppoſe there were neither <hi>Rex</hi> nor <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Pontifex</hi> in all the world (as for the ſpace of 2000. yeeres or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about it was ſo, the firſt borne ſonne of euery family being that while (vnder the law of nature) both king and prieſt in authoritie, without the name: and that all gouernment on earth were (as it ſhould be in that caſe) Ariſtocraticall, yet did not that hinder but that ſtill a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate power ſhoud be aſwell in the church as common-wealth, and lawe and iuſtice there take place in order, ſo as alwaies an appeale might be lawfull and not deniable from an inferior perſon, court, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, common-wealth, or what name, title, or authoritie ſoeuer to a ſuperior (but not on the contrary in any of theſe without preiudice of the predominant) and ſo from one to another till it come to the chiefe and higheſt court. Yea this kinde of ſubordination is euen in the lawes themſelues, the Ciuill lawes (or lawes Common heere in England, which equall the lawes Ciuill) being inferior to the lawes Canon, or municipall in this lande, as is cleere by a plea which ordinarily may be remooued from the common Law into the court of Chauncery: and the law Canon inferior to the law of Nature and Nations (which commonly is taken to be one with Natures lawe) and againe the lawe of Nature to the Law of God, as it is giuen written, or otherwiſe left in the Church <hi>dictante ſpiritu ſancto,</hi> &amp; therefore called the Law diuine, bicauſe it is of diuine inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Though in very, deed the law primary of reaſon depending vpon <hi>ſynderiſis,</hi> &amp; the Law diuine, or of God <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad creaturas,</hi> and alſo the Law of nature, be often taken for all one: vpon which coniunctions, diuiſions, and diſtinctions, I haue treated at large in the anſwere to the firſt part of <hi>Parſons Doleman:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thereupon we will not now ſtand. Onely this is inough to know for the preſent, that all humane lawes are ſubordinate to natures Lawe: and natures Lawes to the Lawe Primary of God himſelfe, which we call, <hi>Diuina voluntas,</hi> or the aeternall Lawe; and by conſequent the legifers of the ſame lawes, are ſo ſubordinate one vnder an other: as when a caſe comes once to the higheſt Legifer on earth, there is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:20192:97"/> thence no further appeale to be made but all wholy left to Gods iuſt iudgements, <hi>Primam enim ſedem nemo iudicare potest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of theſe grounds then I gather theſe corolaries: Firſt, that the Popes excommunication &amp;c. for any matters vnder his Pontificall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and power (although vniuſtly inflicted) were to be obeied in not miniſtring nor receiuing of any Sacrament vntill the party were abſolued &amp;c. Secondly, that no excommunication can ſtoppe any man from ſeeking of iuſtice. Thirdly, that no excommunication of his for diſobedience to his holineſſe ſelfe, in things commanded by him, <hi>contra ius diuinum vel naturae:</hi> doth or can take place either <hi>in foro conſcientiae vel eccleſiae:</hi> bicauſe theſe lawes and legifers are aboue him and his law. Fourthly, that maſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> and his Ieſuits with all thoſe of their faction, are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> thought to be excommunicated for vſurping the Popes authoritie &amp;c. Fiftly, that he can debarre no man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appealing to the Sea apoſtolike for any cauſe whatſoeuer: the worſt being the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellants, if the cauſe be naught: as thereby incurring ſometimes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, ſuſpencion, &amp;c. Sixtly, that it is meere calumniation, falſhood, and ſlander for that ſeditious faction: to giue out: that any one of the Catholikes are excommunicated. Seuenthly, that neither he nor any Ieſuite in England dare for their liues ſtande to it, to affirme: that all or any of the appellants are excommunicated for that action. Eightly, that he is a flat antipope in preſuming to command any not to ſeeke for iuſtice againſt him to the Sea apoſtolike, and the like is for his, and his Ieſuiticall faction in their extreame arrogancy, in blazing it abroad: that it is an act of diſobedience, contempt &amp;c. Ninthly, that no ſuch authority can be giuen him as to command any to obey him in all things. Tenthly, that not the Pope himſelfe can command any, in and by ſuch generall termes of obedience in all things. Eleuenthly, that if the ſeculars had beene iuſtly excommunicated for any matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon the appeale: it had and ought to haue holden ſtill, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame appeale: bicauſe no diſpenſation can be granted where the partie is bent to continue in that ſtate: for the proſecuting whereof the excommunication, ſuſpencion, &amp;c. paſt againſt him. Twelfthly, that if the ſeculars had beene excommunicated for any other matter inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent vpon the appeale, there is not a prieſt in England almoſt, but hath authority to abſolue him: and ſo doth it ſhew the malice of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits to be ſo much greater, ſeeing no ſuch thing, but that, if it were, yet an abſolution did free them againe: they notwithſtanding doe driue conceits into the peoples harts as though they remained ſtill in a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſtate: which is as much to ſay as they cannot be abſolued, (the groſſeſt abſurdity and greateſt impiety that euer was heard of) euery one ſeeing and knowing: that the greateſt heretike that is may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, and reſtored to his former ſtate againe. And therefore they
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20192:97"/> denying this benefite to a Catholike prieſt ſhew themſelues flat vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as before, and a woorſe thing beſides. 13. That there is no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made of it, but if it be poſſible the Ieſuits will procure an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt the ſeculars to confirme their former falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and ſlanders, that they were excommunicated &amp;c. before. 14. That no excommunication on the inuadors behalfe doth bind any man to take his part againſt his prince and countrey. 15. That to this day was there neuer any excommunication, ſuſpencion, interdiction, &amp;c. gotten from the Sea of Rome, and denounced againſt any Prince, perſon, common-weath, or other ſtate on the behalfe of any one <hi>ceteris paribus,</hi> like to this procured already by the Ieſuiticall faction againſt their Prince and countrey on the behalfe of Spainiards. 16. That as the prudent Greeke appealed from <hi>Alexander</hi> furious to <hi>Alexander</hi> ſober, and biſhop <hi>Crostate</hi> from Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> priuate to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> publike: and as <hi>Summus pontifex in cathedra Petri:</hi> ſo may the ſeculars notwithſtanding any decree ſet downe by his holineſſe to the contrary by wrong information giuen: appeale euen from the Pope, as <hi>Clement,</hi> vnto his holineſſe, as <hi>Peter,</hi> on their owne and their Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries behalfe.</p>

Firſt, for that the Ieſuits are a ſocietie and corpotation of themſelues apart, ſequeſtred not onely from other particular orders of religion, as <hi>Dominicans</hi> are from <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans</hi> from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines,</hi> and <hi>Augustines</hi> from <hi>Benedictines,</hi> and ſo one from another by the rules of euery particular order: but alſo and much more then any other religious company from the whole eccleſiaſticall and ſecular ſtate: whereas the ſeculars are of the whole, publike and common bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy both of the Church and common-wealth (that is both of the body myſticall of Chriſt, and the body politicall of their countrey) and as indifferent to a <hi>Benedictine, Augustine, Ieſuit,</hi> &amp;c. as to a Biſhop, Deane, Parſon, Vicar, &amp;c. I meane that though ingenerall termes for matters of faith and religion, they all both ſecular and religious, eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall and monaſticall, are equally members of the catholike church, the body myſticall of Chriſt: and as all corporations, companies, and ſocieties in euery common-welth are equally members ingenerall of that ſame body politicall, common-welth, kingdome, and ſtate where they liue: and yet may ſome of them be more dangerous or ſecure, commodious, or inconuenient, partiall, or indifferent to that ſtate ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall or temporall, church or common-welth where they liue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others are or perhaps can be; by reaſon of more particular reſpects of propriation or otherwiſe, then others haue: yet you wil grant, &amp; none will deny any <hi>Benedictine</hi> to labour lawfully for his owne order ſooner &amp; more ſeriouſly then for the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> in obteining of immunities, priuileges, prerogatiues, liuelihoods, mortmaines, and whatſoeuer they may lawfully receiue and keepe, for maintaining themſelues and their order to ſerue there Lord God in that ſtate of life they haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues vnto. Neither is it to be thought otherwiſe but that the Archbiſhop of Yorke would if a commoditie were to be had, and in his gift to beſtow it where he liſt, more reſpect any particular church,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20192:99"/> chapter, or chappell vnder him and within his owne dioces, then an other of like condition vnto it within the dioces of Canterbury. Nor can it be thought otherwiſe but that the Lord Maior, Aldermen and others of the free companies of London, ſhould haue a more ſpeciall care of augmenting their owne priuileges and the enriching of that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then the citie of Couentrie, or any other corporation or towne, though the ſame were euen alſo infranchized in their liberties. Of like ſort then the Ieſuits being a corporation of themſelues, poſſeſſing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lands nor houſe, nor intereſt to any one (but in their owne vaine conceits) in England, and being a company or ſocietie gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all chriſtian people and nations: and finally this land as well by the fall and ſuppreſſion of the Abbeyes: as alſo by ſundry other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers wherein it ſtands, being now brought by their miſchieuous drifts and deuiſes, and eſpecially by popular doctrine to lie open to the ſpoile of who that firſt can catch it: there is no queſtion in it: but that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits ſeeke their owne priuate gaine, profite, and aduancement, in the conuerſion of England more then the ſeculars doe: who are of no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, but as publike or common members of the whole body, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for all eccleſiaſticall, monaſticall, ſecular, religious, ſpirituall and temporall, and for this and that church, Biſhopricke, citie, towne, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, corporation, ſocietie, &amp;c. alike: as being free to incorporate themſelues to any particular, either eccleſiaſticall or monaſticall ſtate when they liſt, and when occaſion ſhall be offred: and hauing no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar corporation nor company to leaue that vnto which they get, but in generall to their ſucceſſors in the church of God, and their harueſt to whoſoeuer it ſhall happen: it is plaine in common ſenſe, that they ſeeke more ſincerely the conuerſion of their countrey then the Ieſuites do. Secondly, they take a right apoſtolicall courſe, labouring to ſtop all occaſions of ſhedding any mans bloud: and if ſome muſt be ſhedde, yet rather expoſing themſelues with patience to all hazards in ſuffering their owne bloud, to be ſhedde for preaching, teaching, and exerciſing of all other prieſtly functions, then in ſeeking to ſhedde or to haue any others to be ſhedde, either by inuaſions, rebellions, or other treaſons or conſpiracies, whatſoeuer as the Ieſuits do: <hi>ergo</hi> their intention, action, and proceeding is more Apoſtolike, religious, and ſincere. Thirdly, the very ſpeeches that goe abroad of both togither, with the noted practiſe and experience had of both their dealings, do manifeſt it. For who doth not ſee, what a generall calamitie, and extreme want and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery all catholikes, as well ſecular as lay perſons liue in, that are not Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited: what huge ſummes of money they collect euery yeere (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene touched in part) what bankes they haue in other countries, and yet no pittie, no reliefe, no reſpect had of any that are not of their corporation, or as brokers dependent vpon them to ſerue
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:20192:99"/> their turnes withall, vſed as bondſlaues to inrich themſelues with that they haue or can gaine by them. Fourthly, I heere omit their officious enterpriſes for the conuerſion of their countrey: their ſeeking of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie ouer the ſeculars: their barres put into all the bloud royall of this land to diſinherite them: their diuiſion made of all, both eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, monaſticall, and temporall ſtates, corporations and houſes of any reckoning within the land: their deuiſes to preuent as much as they can poſſibly, that no other religious order, eſpecially no <hi>Benedictine</hi> nor <hi>Dominican</hi> ſhall come within the realme: In fewe looke into their whole courſe &amp; manner of proceedings for their countries conuerſion: and you ſhall finde nothing but a large exchequer of a charter of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, how to bring by exchete the whole church &amp; common-wealth to be vnder their priuate corporation &amp; ſocietie: and ſo quite altering the courſe of conuerſion of countries, into a profeſſion of a kinde of Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards: Senſeleſſe be that man or woman holden for euer heereafter: that ſhall iudge any ſinceritie, fidelitie, naturall and humane affection, or other good meaning, to be in them, for reeſtabliſhing of religion or planting the catholike faith in their countrey, if they may haue the ſwing and beare the ſway.</p>

For the preſent, the queſtion here intended is as of a matter of religion, <hi>ſcil.</hi> whether of them being both catholikes haue more cloſe dealings with the common aduerſaries in religion to them both. The cauſe of which queſtion doth riſe vpon theſe Zoiliſts enuious aemula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that ſome few ſeculars (whom they thought either to haue depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their liues, or puld them downe ſo lowe as neuer after to haue riſen) haue by Gods prouidence found grace, fauour and iuſtice at her Maieſties hands: by opening their innocencie and loyall harts towards her royall perſon and their natiue countrey, to thoſe in authority vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Highneſſe: as maſter doctor <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> (whoſe death they moſt treacherouſly ſought) and others (whom now they ſeeing to haue

In regard of which viperous ſpeech (fitter for a feinde then faithfull ſoule) the queſtion heere is mooued: if it be an offence to haue any ſecret dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with the ciuill magiſtrate, then whether the ſeculars or Ieſuits haue offended more therein. To which I anſwere heere in briefe: that if any offence be in that action, the Ieſuits will ouerweigh as farre the ſeculars in that as a horſe load will a pound weight: as the practiſes and dealings of their <hi>Parſons,</hi> their <hi>Heywoods,</hi> their <hi>Holts,</hi> their <hi>Holtbeis,</hi> their <hi>Creſwele,</hi> their <hi>Garnets,</hi> &amp;c. will teſtifie it, by ſundry letters and witneſſes againſt them to be brought foorth and ſhewed at time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. Yea doe they thinke it is vnknowne vnder whoſe wings the Archprieſt liues ſhrowded, or to and from whom the letter was ſent on father <hi>Gerards</hi> behalfe, to wiſh her (after ſome fewe complements and thanks for the token ſhe ſent him) to keepe her iewell (the ſaide <hi>Gerard</hi>) well, &amp;c. or who they be, that plie and plead for the Ieſuits vnderhand, and to whom in ſpeciall intelligence is giuen from time to time of all that euer they know that may not touch the Ieſuits: or ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by accuſing ſome of their owne company, to contriue ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt or ſluttiſh part they are about, more handſomely then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they could, or by whom they are backt to be ſo bold as they are, both in priſon and abroad, to make their vaunt that they haue moe and greater friends both in the Engliſh and Scottiſh Court; then the ſeculars haue: more then halfe (naming ſome particular nobles and others in high eſteeme and authoritie vnder her Maieſtie) that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly entred into league with them (forſooth) on the Spaniſh behalfe. Nor noe, it is but a baſe feare of that ſeruile <hi>Parſons</hi> minde, leaſt by this fauour ſhewed of her Maieſtie, her honorable Counſell, and other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats to thoſe tried to be innocent and guiltleſſe of the generall iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie for conſpiracies, had of all for their ſakes: his treaſons and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries ſhould boult out more ſpeedily, and not haue ſo ſafe cloſe, and ſecret meanes to tamper with any, to deale on his behalfe with her Highnes: to accept of him for a ſpie, as earſt he offered himſelfe to be ſo: with deepe proteſtation and many vowes and circumſtances, that he would (yea and no doubt but in matters for his owne aduantage he doth) by his agents giue intelligence to the ſtate of all things that

But this doubt comes of a Ieſuiticall enuie and malice towards the ſeculars: like to the ſame their ſpeeches in effect vſed in France and againſt the French king, when they enuiouſly murmuring at the peace, was there concluded vpon, vſed moſt ſlanderous detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpeeches, and put an hundred rebellious doubts and irreligious conceits in the peoples harts againſt it, and ſo haue they done, and will doe, the like heere in England if any peace or quiet may be happily obteined to catholiks to liue ſecure and without trouble, of danger of law for their conſcience and religions ſake. Which (I feare) woulde euen breake the Ieſuits enuious harts to thinke on, and make them burſt out into an open rebellion; either to hinder it, or to haue it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on their ſide.

But letting former examples paſſe, I ſay no more thereof then this; that be you fully perſwaded and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what bribes can worke, what gifts can winne, what women can mooue (and none more potent in moouing then they (ſaid <hi>Parſons</hi> in <hi>Greenecote:</hi>) what lying can deceiue in, what impudency can face, what flattery can allure to, what promiſes can intice to, what hope can vrge, what proteſtations can perſwade to, what wit can inuent: to hinder all furtherance aide, conſent, or good liking to be had of this fauour to be ſhewed, that ſame ſhall not be wanting to the vttermoſt. But yet this withall will I giue them to weerds, that thoſe who are now furtheſt of from liking or conſenting to the ſeculars in their action: ſhall wiſh when they cannot helpe it, that it had beene neereſt them in ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them and it both, with all their might: and ſo to the diuerſly membred article I anſwere thus diuerſly. Firſt, that theſe lay catholiks as are eager on the Ieſuits or Archprieſts behalfe, are heereafter in the ſame predicament of a <hi>praemunire,</hi> treaſon, &amp;c. that their good ghoſtly fathers before ſpoken of are in. Secondly, that ere theſe matters came to light, &amp; before the appeale was made, there was no more danger in following of a Ieſuit or the Archprieſt, then in following a Seminary or other ſecular prieſt: bicauſe they were not then diſcouered, the one from the other: nor euer ſhould haue beene in thoſe caſes if the Ieſuits might haue had their wils as the only Scugge, buckler and ſconce, they had to beare off all the blowes that of due right ſhould haue fallen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: and not of the innocent ſeculars, which was and is, one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall cauſe why they labour ſo mightily to make all bookes (written of theſe matters, in diſcouery of their egregious impietie both againſt the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20192:103"/> Church and common-wealth) to ſeeme ſo odious, and to ſuppreſſe ſo much as lieth in them, the Printing, and if not the Printing, yet the reading; and if not the reading, yet the beleeuing of any thing in them, to be true: though the authors haue and doe ſtill offer body for body to burne at a ſtake, or hang on the gallowes for triall, in auerring or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting of whatſoeuer (in ſubſtance) hath beene written or ſpoken againſt them. Thirdly, as for neuters or indifferents, they do but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wrong: in cauſing a iealous conceite perhaps cauſeleſſe to be had of them. Fourthly, for thoſe that refuſe to deale being moued to be vmpiers, or otherwiſe to further ſo good, commendable, and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an enterpriſe, which no doubt but will be commended to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie: let them looke to the danger that may enſue: and ſo I leaue them to their beſt thoughts had of thoſe matters; fearing leaſt ſome of them will too truely verifie the ſaying: that a Counſellour at lawe, is as wiſe as a dawe vnleſſe he be amongſt fooles, &amp;c. For I was not ignorant at the writing heereof, how ſome Ieſuiticall lawyers that ſeeme ſome body, and are taken ſo to be, both ſchiſmatike ſome, and catholike others: haue not onely refuſed themſelues, but made others refuſe to deale heerein. <hi>Sed videant ipſi.</hi>

This therefore is peoples error, put into their heads by theſe new illuminates. Secondly, it is but an accuſtomed coggerie of the Ieſuits, to make theſe bookes and writings againſt them ſeeme odious, and ſuch a deed as neuer was done before: their drift therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely to continue their credite with the laitie; to increaſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt had in all men of the ſeculars: and to perfect their miſchieuous platforme caſt for the deſtruction of their prince and countrey there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: which drift of theirs, may eaſely be perceiued of any halfe witted body that doth but conſider, that if ſuch things may be, and that the Ieſuits be men, and therefore fraile, and as ſubiect to fall into ſinne as others are: then ſure it cannot be otherwiſe choſen but that they are guiltie of all theſe crimes laid to their charge, and knowing not in all the world how to excuſe or defend themſelues if it come to triall (the ſeculars vrging ſo vehemently as they do:) they haue no other ſhift but to ſtop the peoples eares, eies, and vnderſtanding from comming to the knowledge of theſe matters. Which ſtoppage can be by no other meanes then to make theſe bookes and writings ſet out to diſcouer them to be holden for infamous libels, and Satyricall inuectiues: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be read nor anſwered. And this is a ſecond falſe ſurmiſe or cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie of the Ieſuits, to keepe the ignorant in error. Thirdly, whoſoeuer ſhall reade and examine theſe 10. <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> and other bookes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt the Ieſuits from point to point, ſhall finde, that there is no ſuch detraction, ſlander, or bitter ſpeech vſed as they talke of, nor ſo
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20192:104"/> much as perhaps were neceſſary to diſcouer as the caſe ſtands: (for that the particulars of any one mans priuate life and actions as they are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, with correſpondencie had to the generall or common cauſe, are not as yet touched) but the cauſe ſo handled agreeing to the diuerſitie of men, matter, time and place, diſcuſſed of in theſe Interrogatories, ſo, as the anſwere may paſſe currant and apparant, couertly, exactly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyntly without either interruption of iuſtice, on the one ſide violated by concealing things neceſſary to be made knowne for cleering of the innocent <hi>(fiat enim iuſtita &amp; ruant caeli)</hi> or without breach of charitie on the other ſide hindred by reuealing of ſecret faults of any one imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the manifeſtation of what ingenerall is intended. And heere I account the ſecret faults which are needleſſe or not at all to be opened, to be whoredome, drunkenneſſe, robbery on the high way, or in ſecret burghlary and the like offences: which come of paſſion or frailtie of man. And againe, I account theſe publike, common, or generall faults, though committed by priuate perſons, which riſe of pride, ambition, &amp;c. may either indanger the church or common-wealth, or hinder the common cauſe, by taking away the life of any publike perſon: or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing any one to hinder the ſame: or finally be the cauſe directly, or indirectly, of leading ignorant people into errour, or miſconceit: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the doctrine of the catholike church, and reſolute beleefe of euery obedient childe and member of the ſame. And of this latter kind are the detractions and defamations (if any be) againſt the Ieſuits, which euery catholike prieſt is bound vnto to make things knowne: and euery loyall ſubiect and dutifull childe, is to take notice thereof: for auoiding their owne danger both of body and ſoule. Therefore muſt it needs follow, that foraſmuch as a libell or inuectiue imports a calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation or ſlander againſt any or many, publike or priuate perſons, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſpecial &amp; peculiar intent, either of reuenge or preferring a priuate faction or action, in oppoſition againſt a publike cauſe: the matter here handled, and the wrong done, being no priuate hurt, but a publike harme, no ſole foule danger, but a common-wealth damage; no indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduall action of the perſon, but a ſpecificall or rather genericall facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the caſe that is heere in requeſt amongſt vs, on the behalfe of the catholike church in generall: and our natiue countrey, togither with all other common-wealths: * It may not be left, nor accounted of, as a libelling againſt the ſeditious Ieſuits and their priuate faction: but turning backe the diuels malice vpon himſelfe, and their ſlanders of the innocent vpon their owne heads: I conclude that as the relinquiſhing of the Ieſuits for Phariſees and conſpirators againſt God and their countrey (as they are) were the ſafeſt way for all catholikes, ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, or other of their and the Puritanes fautors: ſo were it alſo the Ieſuits beſt courſe to auoide the lande, and thoſe pure ſpirited children
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20192:104"/> of theirs that will come now at no ſeculars, nor much leſſe heereafter, (if they euer depart) it were beſt for them to be packing with them, and make triall what will be the end of them both, if they delight ſo much as it ſeemeth they doe in nouelties and change: and when they are all gone, and the great new Abbot with them: or whether they be all exiled and baniſhed the land or no, (which were great pittie but they ſhould) let them know this: that the Church of God hath no neede of any of them, and the common-wealth much leſſe: as both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſo peſtered with them as a greater ſecuritie could not come to either ſtate Eccleſiaſticall or temporall, then to concurre by one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vtterly to expell them the land. And although it greeues my very hart to thinke, that ſo many vertuous and truely ſincere catholikes and religious men and women are deluded by their Phariſaicall life ſo much, as greatly it is to be feared (becauſe greatly (if it happen) to be lamented) that if they ſhould fall into manifeſt Apoſtaſie or open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion (as they are in a great forwardneſſe to both) or any other exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable error: theſe fondlings would follow them euen into hell mouth, ſpite of prieſt or pope himſelfe, ſo vainly are many perſwaded of them. Yet falſe prophets ſhall they prooue, and ſo let them truſt vnto it: as a generall receiued veritie of all true catholikes throughout the world; and flat hereſie to defend the contrary that ſhall dare preſume to affirme the fall and ſtand of the catholike church, faith, and religion, to depend vpon them: No, no, if euery one of their brokers were a profeſſed Ieſuit: and euery profeſſed Ieſuite a prouinciall ouer a 1000. Rectors: and euery Rector had vnder him 10000. miniſters: and euery miniſter ſo many nouices: &amp; euery nouice a Parſonian ſpirite: and after all this if the prowd gates of infernall dungeons were broken vp, and that they had all the helpes out of <hi>Stix, Corceris,</hi> and <hi>Fligiton,</hi> that olde ſatanas Segnior <hi>Belzebuh Don Lucifer,</hi> or <hi>Damp.

                  <p>IT was ſpoken of late, as from a Lady of high renowne, to one of her women in her bed chamber (but I will not ſay the Counteſſe ſpoke it, becauſe her woman not her Lady was Ieſuited, and therefore likely to be a plot of her ghoſtly fathers; fathered vpon her honorable Miſtres) that neither her Maieſtie, nor the Lords of her Highneſſe honorable Counſell ment any more good or ſcant ſo much to the ſeculars as to the Ieſuits: but only for the time preſent to get out of the ſeculars being but ſimple men, what they coulde by this meanes: and firſt ſet them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to worke out the Ieſuits, and then to picke a quarrell at the ſaide ſeculars to make them all away &amp;c. Which wordes ſmell ſo ranke of a Ieſuiticall breth, as they can not be imagined to come of any other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Firſt, for the great indignitie included in them to regall Maieſty, eſpecially againſt our dread Soueraigne and honorable Counſell, as to impute vnto them, ſo cruell and neuer heard of the like tyranny to maſſacre the innocent: who labouring wholy for her Maieſties realmes ſafety, deſire nothing to themſelues, but an abiect quiet in a frownd on ſtate. Secondly, for the accuſtomed arrogancie of a Ieſuiticall ſpirite: in that, in contempt of prieſthood and all ſeculars: they would impute this danger to come as their manner is by reaſon of the ſeculars want of experience, &amp;c. Thirdly, be it ſo: (as it were too to preiudiciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and ſaucie a part for any ſubiect eſpecially liuing in like to this of our frownd on ſtate, to cauſe any ſuch iealouſie to be had of their Soueraigne and honorable Counſel) that no good were ment, but hard meaſure intended to be offred to the innocent by ſhedding of guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe bloud, adding affliction to affliction, and ſo increaſing all our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries by this ſmall comfort of liberty graunted to ſome few particulars: yet three commodities would enſue heereof which now we al do want: one is that we ſhould then ſuffer but one kinde of perſecution, whereas now we ſuffer two at once, the Ieſuits tongue torments being more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and heauie vnto vs then our aduerſaries racks, ropes, or Tiburne tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets: an other is, that if we may by meanes of his holineſſe commaund get riddance of the Ieſuits hence out of the land, and an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finde libertie granted to all catholike priſoners, we ſhould not then feare to die of famine, which now many are very like ſhortly to die of vnleſſe her Maieſtie take pittie of them euen of her innate princely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and of her meere mercy: all that be in Framlingham caſtel readie to ſtarue already as receiuing no maintenance nor reliefe of the common beneuolence. And a third (but not the leaſt) is an aſſured hope, that by ſuch a means al ſhould die glorious martyrs, as freed from thoſe factious ſeditions, and trayterous diſpoſitions, wherewith <hi>Parſons</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:20192:105"/> that traitor attainted, hath brought all to be had in ielouſie.

Which for that it may fitly be applied to our purpoſe concerning this contention betwixt the ſeculars and Ieſuits, I will firſt ſet it downe at large to the ſame effect he hath left it to poſteritie to looke vpon, and then apply it to our particular caſe and cauſe. The ſumme of his ſpeech conſiſts of this point, to wit: how that the contention, which amongſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:20192:106"/> the wicked is naught as proceeding of rancor, malice and reuenge: the ſame amongſt the good and otherwiſe ſincerely vertuous, is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: as proceeding of zeale, true pietie and perfect charitie euen in the middeſt of their hart breaking broiles. The ſequele enſuing vpon his ſpeech is this: that if there haue been in heauen high ambition; in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe too much curioſitie; in the Apoſtles ſchoole, a contentious deſire of ſoueraigntie; in the indubitate ſeate of infallible truth, three and twenty ſchiſmes already paſt, ſometimes two, otherwhile three Popes (though but one <hi>Summus pontifex</hi> and he holy and <hi>Peter</hi>) in oppoſition by different elections one againſt an other, and ſo continuing the ſchiſme 3. 7. 20. 30. 40. 50. yeeres together (ſome <hi>lucidum interuallum</hi> paſſing now and then betweene) ere it was ended: Emperors and kings and the mighties of the world interchangeably ſtanding in a faction now with one, then with an other, ſometimes with moſt infeſt warres, yea cruell deathes of the vanquiſhed Antipapes, and perturbers of the Churches peace, which with all thoſe tempeſtuous ſtormie blaſts could not be blowne vp nor faile in faith, ſtanding the oracle irreprooueable, <hi>ego rogaui pro te Petre vt non deficiat fides tua &amp;c.</hi> Then neither is it to be wondered at in theſe contentions: if ſome wicked Ieſuits of Luciferian ambition, Euauiſtian curioſitie, Iudaſtiall deſire of gaine &amp; contempt of ordinarie authoritie, ſtir vp ſtrife, cauſe rebellion, and make inuouations of ancient cuſtomes and new gods amongſt the people: ſet vp an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pape, golden calfe, or Archprieſt, and commit all impietie vnder colour of religion: and yet with <hi>Core, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> ſaucily preſume to tell both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Pope and Prince, ſtate eccleſiaſticall and temporall, that they take too much vpon them: nay that they are ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, diſobedient and factious that ſpeake againſt them for ſo doing, and that they are but trifles, which they make ſo much adoe about. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be iudged, that all haue dipt their hands a like deepe in theſe contentions, or intentions on the Ieſuits ſide: though all alike dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous (that concurre with them, or are agents for them, as I ſaid before) both to the Church and common wealth (by reaſon of the aide and furtherance of the conſpirators and principall agents, which in this caſe they yeeld) in the intent of the plot-caſters; to the ouerthrowe of all gouernment, religion and authoritie; but in their owne intent (at leaſt in many of them) to the ſetting vp of religion againe in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſimply and plainly: ſome of them no doubt, thinking it impoſſible to be brought to paſſe, but by inuaſion and conqueſt of the land: and this onely by falſe perſwaſions of the Ieſuits: whoſe intents many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout both men and women thinking to be ſincere, good, iuſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the lawes both of God and the catholike Church; doe hereupon proſecute their purpoſe, as being led away with indiſcreete zeale.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20192:106"/> Whether their courſe (ſuppoſing one or two Ieſuits be of that minde, and go no further gaping after gaine, honor or renowne, which <hi>Parſons</hi> and other of their chiefe ambitious practitionall ſtate Ieſuits aime at) or the ſeculars courſe be of more aſſurance for the conuerſion of our countrie: which of them is moſt conformable to catholike doctrine and beleefe: and what examples can be brought on either ſide. This is the point I now ſtand vpon: and the effect of the Spaniſh Biſhops and cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle before mentioned, tends to this end in forme following.</p>

Then the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> and principall of <hi>Iudea</hi> (S. <hi>Michaell</hi> as it ſeemed) replied and ſaid: that though it were the men which liued in the world, and not the world it ſelfe which they all had charge of in chiefe: yet becauſe man came of earth, and in <hi>Salem</hi> citie was <hi>Adam</hi> our protoplaſt created: therefore was the prerogatiue royall giuen to <hi>Iebus</hi> land to be called <hi>Terra ſancta</hi> for euer after.

And although their anceſtors liued in bondage 400. yeeres ſpace vnder the Aegyptian <hi>Pharaos:</hi> during which time ſeuen mighty nations of ſundry warlike people (whereof the chiefe being <hi>Cananites,</hi> gaue the name to the whole land) inhabited ouer all, yet did not that diſcontinuance any whit diſable their rightful title and claime,

                  <p>With this anſwere was not the Angell of Perſe contented: but held on his plea on the Gentiles ſide: affirming, that, as it was for their ſins, that God in his iuſtice had reiected Iſraells iſſue, ſo, although it pleaſed him to manifeſt his omnipotent power and Maieſty that man might ſay: <hi>non in carneo brachio corroborabitur vir,</hi> and that there was no God, but the Lord God of Iſraell alone: yet was not his mercy ſo tied to their ſleeue, as after ſo many ſignes, tokens, prodigious woonders, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſhewed for their ſakes in open ſight of all their enemies, as amongſt the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> (before named) the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Edomites</hi> and all other nations round about them, he ſhould ſtill forgiue and forget to puniſh them, agreeing to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits as hitherto he had: but that the deſtinies of their daies drawing to an end, the fatall web of their woes being at hand, and the period of their time now approching? there was no expectation to be had of their returne, nor in rigor of iuſtice, any motion to be made on that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. And euen <hi>Daniell, Ezechiell, Ieremie,</hi> and the reſt of the prophets doe know that the quadrupart monarchie began in <hi>Babylon</hi> vnder <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonoſor,</hi> which ſhall continue to the end, by tranſlation from the <hi>Chaldeis</hi> to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> as now it is, and from them to the ſtout, inuicted <hi>Macedonian Greeke:</hi> from whom by reuolution af time it ſhall deſcend to the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſacred <hi>Senate:</hi> and whoſoeuer be the monarchie: vnder that prince, power and potentate, ſhall the Iewes captiues liue.

But to this roundly and readily <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachies</hi> Angell made anſwere agreeing to the minde of the <hi>Perſians</hi> guardian: that as he had ſaid, ſo true it was: that <hi>non eſt perſonarum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio apud Deum,</hi> but that who, when, and in what place ſoeuer the name of God ſhall be called vpon, there, then, and by that ſame perſon ſhall his name be glorified. And for the particulars: <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in deed was the holy city, and ſo it ſhould be counted to the worlds end, not for that <hi>Adam</hi> was therein created, liued, died, and his ſcul buried in mount <hi>Caluarie:</hi> not for that it was the ſeate of the holy line deuoluted from <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſt: not for that the law, the prophets, the ſacrifice, and the high prieſts gaue the prerogatiues of all ſanctitie and holines to this place before any other: But that which made that land holy, that people holy, that line holy, that city holy, was: bicauſe the holy of all holies Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God, and <hi>Mary</hi> the immaculate treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred bleſſed virgine, came out of that line, liued in that land, was

Whoſe perſonall birth, life and death, as they left an ineſtimable ſanctitie behinde them to that land: ſo the Iewes wilfully depriuing themſelues of ſo inualua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a price as he paied for mans redemption, haue woorthily deſerued an vtter extirpation of their race, a ſubuerſion of their ſtate, and a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity, bondage, and ſlauerie of themſelues and their poſteritie for euer. And although there had been and were during the time of captiuitie many holy, religious and deuout men and women amongſt them: yet not onely bicauſe the greateſt part of the multitude and ſundry of their kings, princes and gouernors had offended their Lord God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, which is in ſchiſme, hereſie, and apoſtaſie, with idolatrie, ſo highly diſpleaſing the diuine maieſtie, as the puniſhment of thoſe vices hath alwaies beene this: <hi>videl.</hi> a conqueſt of the land, a downefall of nobilitie, a deſolation of the ſtate, a deflowring of their virgins, a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring of their wiues, a maſſacre of their ancients, a population of the common wealth, and a ſeruile life to all their youth, led captiues out of their natiue land.

                  <p>THis queſtion is ſufficiently debated before, to wit: That although all or any one appointed by her Maieſtie to deale in theſe affaires meant fraudulently and with intent to intrap the ſeculars one way or other, to worke their greater diſcredite diſgrace and vtter ouerthrowe thereby (which yet were very ingrateful, vnciuill and inhumane for any ſo to iudge and cenſure without cauſe: for as it is ſaid, it is ſinne to lie of the diuell: and ſure this calumniation and ſlaunder raiſed of theſe men for their intercourſe with thoſe in authoritie vnder her Maieſtie, declares a moſt malitious Ieſuiticall ſpirite: there being no queſtion to be made of it to the contrary (bicauſe former examples of other Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites haue proued it true, and led the ſeculars firſt the daunce, in ſeeking of fauours at ciuill magiſtrates or others hands) but that if either Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Blackwel,</hi> or Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> or any Ieſuite of them all that deale now in hucker mucker (and therefore more daungerouſly and pernitiouſly as I ſaid before) might haue free acceſſe, and either were as cleere in their owne conſcience as theſe ſeculars are, or elſe might haue imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue iuſtice by conuiuence from her Maieſtie on their ſide to obtaine ſo much fauour by, as theſe haue obtained: there is not the pureſt of them but would come with his hat in his hand to the Biſhop of London, or to any other in authority for to be ſhrowded vnder them: and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent

But the diuell is euer enuious.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20192:112"/> An enuious man is alwaies murmuring, grudging, and repining at an others good fortunes: and to heare of a Ieſuitical fellow to giue a good word of any that is not Ieſuited in faction or affection: he ſure by my conſent ſhall be a king cipher, to command the nine figures in algo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme: with (o) rare, amongſt the rareſt illuminates.</p>
                  <p>So then to the purpoſe to make an end of this <hi>Quodlibet,</hi> I ſay, Firſt, that there is more aſſurance, and haue beene more perfect and true tokens of conſtancie wiſedome, pietie, religion, learning, vertue and gouernment in all theſe: whom the Ieſuits doe moſt kicke at, and ſpurne againſt (for familiarity or intercourſe by writing, acceſſe, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall parlee, and other meanes with thoſe in authoritie vnder her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie) then in the prowdeſt ſpirited Ieſuit in this land whoſoeuer, that may freelieſt ſay: <hi>Non ſum ſicut caeteri homines,</hi> nor like theſe Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſeculars. Yea neither maſter <hi>Clarke,</hi> maſter <hi>Barneby,</hi> nor maſter <hi>Champney</hi> (who are the yoongeſt of theſe thus extraordinary fauoured) but a prieſtly behauiour hath merited vnto them by their conſtant ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance (before it came to this gratious conniuence to fauour them) ſo reuerend a reſpectiue opinion to be had of them by all men, as that their yoong yeeres ouer-ſhadowed with venerable grauitie of hoarieſt haires, might in their milde conceits with modeſt bluſh, mooue them to take S. <hi>Paules</hi> words to Biſhop <hi>Timothie</hi> as ſpoken vnto euery one of them apart: <hi>nemo te contemnat propter, inuentutem:</hi> yea euen maſter <hi>Barneby</hi> (the yoongeſt as I take it a moſt ſweete natured faire condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and humble harted gentleman of good abilitie) might well haue merited that grace and fauour at the Apoſtles hands. And for the reſt ſcz. doctor <hi>Bagſhawe,</hi> maſter <hi>Bluet,</hi> maſter <hi>Muſhe,</hi> and maſter <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> with others, but thoſe eſpecially had of the Ieſuits faction nowe in chaſe, I am fully perſwaded that howſoeuer ſome ſurly ſyres, or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing outraiers doe ſcorne and ſcoffe at them behinde their backes: yet woulde their very preſence, countenance, and conuerſation, put them to ſilence, or at the leaſt daſh them from euer entring into ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſpeeches as now they vſe againſt them. Not one of theſe fower but (being any Ieſuits auncient, as a Ieſuite in England this day) they woulde be iudged of all indifferent perſons: to be more fit to gouerne both maſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> and all his puny Fathers, then to be gouerned of all or any of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Ieſuiticall arrogancie is moſt egregious in this point, when they ſay, I pray God maſter <hi>Bluet</hi> be not ouertaken, hee truſts and tels the Biſhop of London too much, and doctor <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> he doth the like with maſter <hi>Waade</hi> and ſo others of them: and I pray God they ſtand ſaith one: and they are but weake men ſaith another and vnfit to deale in ſuch matters: and (O) that ſuch or ſuch a father had had the managing of the matter: he could and would (I mary would he) haue
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:20192:113"/> handled it more ſubſtantially, and to the purpoſe: whereas like vaine glorious Phariſees as they are, many of thoſe of whom they vaunt moſt, knew neuer what impriſonment nor any triall meant: but riding to and fro in their coaches like Sur-le-boyes, mount-ſegniors, or other men of ſtate (as vnwoorthie the name of a Ieſuite vnleſſe withall a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt) they lie pampering themſelues heere and there, ſurfeiting in ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ambition, and deepe diſdaine: and when they haue put on the cap of maintenance amongſt their admirabliers, then they begin to deſcant vpon al mens actions, and fyle their tongues agreeing to their auditors fancies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there neither is, neither can be any offence committed or danger incurd, or ſcandall giuen in theſe fauours receiued: vnleſſe it be Iewiſh, Phariſaicall (otherwiſe now rightly called a malitious Ieſuiticall ſcandall) which to refraine from, were the moſt ſimple, indiſcrete, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, vniuſt, vnciuill, and immodeſt part that euer was plaied. Therefore let theſe newe Phariſees, chooſe whether they will be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized or no, it is nothing to the purpoſe. For if they finde a Haggard readie to baite at euery buſh, or an eyeeſe ready to crie at ſight of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cricket, or a ſcrupulous, tender, and timerous hart readie to feare offending, in euery worde he ſpeakes: then haue theſe maſter Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that which they looke for, theſe great Burgo-maſters the thing they ſeeke for, and the Ieſuiticall tribe, their treacherous harts deſire.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is no aſſurance of any one catholikes perſeuerance to the end, that liues on earth. For who that had ſeene <hi>Lucifer</hi> the day ſtar gliſtring <hi>in excelſis</hi> but would haue honoured him before Saint <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> the Archangell: and yet in <hi>ictu occuli</hi> he became a fowle fiend and loathſomeſt creature to looke vpon that euer God created? Who that knew king <hi>Salomon</hi> to haue had the rareſt and chiefeſt gift that euer was giuen to man, beſides that, the gift of prophecie: alſo a more neere familiarity with God then I thinke any Ieſuite dare preſume to affirme he euer had: (and yet I cannot tell they are ſo arrogant) as for to walke and talke with him (be it mediate or immediate all is one) face to face: who then that had ſeene him in his higheſt pompe, royalleſt Maieſtie, and greateſt glory would not haue come with the <hi>Saban Queene</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him and adore him? who that had ſeene <hi>Iudas</hi> choſen by God himſelfe (who could not be ignorant of what was in the man) to be a prieſt, an apoſtle, yea and one of the twelue that our Sauiour choſe out of the whole worlde) but would haue kiſſed the ground where he went, &amp;c? who of like ſort that had heard the holy Ghoſt ſpeake it, and conſecrate, deſigne and ſingle out ſeauen Deacons: whereof <hi>Nicholas</hi> was one, would euer haue thought he would haue prooued a puritane, or one infected with the family of loue, or rather the firſt beginner and brocher of the ſame? who that had read <hi>Apollonaris</hi> workes in 33.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20192:113"/> huge volumes againſt the heretikes of his daies: would euer haue cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured or thought he would in the end haue become a ranke heretike, yea and a father and author of moſt blaſphemous hereſies? who that had ſeene the Chanon or Doctor of Paris liuing a life irreprehenſible of any man, would not haue beene ready to come and kiſſed his feete, gone on pilgrimage to his ſhrine, or done any worſhip vnto him on earth, and yet with horror to thinke of mans heauy ſtate, not one of theſe but are knowne to be condemned, vnleſſe it be king <hi>Salomon</hi> of whom ſome doctors doubt, who yet I thinke would not be in his place for a myriades of millions of maſſie golde: <hi>ergo qui ſtat videat ne cadat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, as our ſtand in Gods church is vncertaine, and knowne onely to God alone: So there is not the hotteſt of our aduerſaries in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that a man can ſay or iuſtifie and bide by it: that it is impoſſible or no poſſibilitie nor likelihood in the world, that euer ſuch or ſuch a one ſhould become a catholike: for we haue to the contrary innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable examples in this age. Many of our owne knowledge hauing been noted and knowne to all the world for moſt lewd, prophane, and bad liuers: yet haue come afterwards to giue manifeſt ſignes, tokens, and teſtimonies of their true repentance, rare graces, and extraordinarie amendment. Yea euen <hi>Parſons</hi> (a lewder body then whom, was not I verily thinke, of any that is now a Prieſt in England to be found: nor in whom were leſſe ſignes of true conuerſion when he firſt preſumed to take that ſacred function vpon him) yet if a man ſhould go ſo ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to worke with him, as he and his doe with others: who that had ſeen and knowne him in Oxford and his dealings there, how ſeditious, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, &amp; factious this leud baſtards conuerſation was: how for his libelling and other miſdemeanour he was thruſt out of Balyoll Colledge (and not for religion as he vainely vaunts, doctor <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> being then fellow of the ſame Colledge, and his ſtiffe aduerſarie in the matters obiected againſt him, which I verily thinke is cauſe of a greater hatred in all the Ieſuits againſt the ſaid doctor now, as an accident proper to that ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be reuengefull to death: How he became ſo infamous there being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maſter of Arts, that they hiſſed him out with whoubs &amp; hoo-bubs, &amp; rung him thence with bels: how after his expulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence or relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by compulſion that place and Colledge, he deepely proteſted vpon occaſion of ſpeech to one <hi>Iames Clark</hi> his old ſchoolfellow then abiding in the inner Temple, that he neither then was, neither euer meant to be a papiſt (for ſo it pleaſed that good fellow to call vs catholikes at that time) &amp; offered for his better ſatisfaction therein to take an oth before him for aſſurance of the ſame: who I ſay that had &amp; heard &amp; ſeene the man at that time, yea and euer ſince had conuerſed with him, and noted well his whole life and conuerſation: would euer haue preferd him for any good part or acte of pietie, or ſigne of grace, before any the ſeeming

For which intent and none other but to pull downe our peacocks plumy harts, to keepe our ſoules in awe, and our conſciences in feare, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other to murmure or make compariſons with Gods graces &amp; our deſerts: it was parabolizd of the laborers, that had al a like pay at night, though ſome of them came not paſſing three houres before ſupper: and others at noone tide: &amp; yet were equald with thoſe that came in the morning, and had borne <hi>onus diei</hi> vpon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

And therefore is it of all other the moſt dangerous point to deale in without offence of any: whom I would not willingly offend for mine owne part in any thing, by reaſon of ſpeciall occurrents, which being handled as ſome here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore haue handled them, might breede great, apparant and manifeſt danger either to body or ſoule, or both together. For here I am to intreate of excommunications and depoſitions of princes, of pontificall power and regall maieſtie, and of other points of moſt importance that in a world can be found. And bicauſe I am a catholike by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and an Engliſhman by birth and education: in reſpect of the former religion doth inioyne me to acknowledge to death an humble obedience to the one and onely treſſacred apoſtolicall catholike Roman Church, the See Apoſtolike, and our mother Citie. And hereupon I ſay with that reuerend prelate the laſt catholike Archbiſhop of Yorke, that howſoeuer his holines hath beene heretofore or may be hereafter <hi>durus Pater</hi> vnto vs and our nation, by inflicting excommunications or other eccleſiaſticall cenſures vpon our prince, countrie or our ſelues, and thereby occaſionating our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier

                  <head>THE ANSWERE.</head>
                  <p>THat it is now, and euer hath been lawfull, for the clergie in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to deale in ſtate matters and affaires, practiſe, experience, and conſent of all perſons, nations, times and ages doe approoue, ratifie and confirme it: not a legifer, not a lawe, not a parliament, not an act ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, nor decree made without the Lords ſpirituall: yea the word State it ſelfe, when we talke of ſtate affaires, hath a relation to an eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſtate, which being the firſt and principall of the two members in a bodie politicall: once depriue the clergie of all dealings or medlings any manner of way in ſtate matters, and then repeale, reuoke, reuert all ſtatute lawes, and put out thoſe words (Lords ſpirituall) for euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the firſt moſt ancient and woorthily prime inueſted Barons of this land (as all Biſhops of England are) being theſe Lords ſpirituall or ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall ſtate. Therefore can I not but often ſmile in my ſleeue to heare and ſee the Ieſuits coggery in euery thing; and how that now of late it is blowne abroad amongſt catholiks, that the ſecular prieſts (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) are become prophane lay perſons in conuerſation, ſtudying onely ſtate matters, and practizing with the ciuill magiſtrate in ſtate affaires. Vpon occaſion of which ſpeech, a gentlewoman in a paſſage of theſe matters at her table, ſaide to a ſecular prieſt (my ſelfe being
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:20192:116"/> there preſent vnknowne, and therfore freer to laugh as I did hartily to heare her) nay my maſters (quoth ſhe) if you once become ſtateſmen, and haue dealings with the Lords of the Counſell or other ciuill magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, then I haue done with you: For I neuer could heare of anie Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, that did ſo. As though there coulde be no dealings in matters of ſtate, but that the party muſt be acceſſary to an acte of treaſon, and be holden for a ſtatizer in a ſenſe deteſtable. Well, let it paſſe for a Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iticall iangling, and leauing the etymologie: we will come to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon phraſe and acceptance of this worde State and Statiſte as they are now taken, and thereby ſhall be ſeene, ere this <hi>Quodlibet</hi> be ended, whether the ſeculars or Ieſuits are greater ſtatiſts: that is, intermedlers in ſtate affaires. And for the time preſent I ſay as followeth.</p>
                  <p>In anſwere to the Interrogatory (which is of many members) I ſay; Firſt, that it pertaines to all ſecular and eccleſiaſticall perſons, equally and indifferently be they catholikes, proteſtants, or puritanes: to deale in ſtate affaires in two caſes, the one is for the rectifying of mens and womens conſciences, and inſtructing all ſuch as are of their flocke and liue vnder their charges how they are to behaue themſelues to God, their prince, and their countrey: when, and in what caſes, bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge obedience to the one or the other, either coniunct or a part: and what is to be done in times of perſecution, ciuill warres, or forraigne inuaſions, and the like: the other is for making, giuing, and promulgating of lawes, publiſhing of bookes, and preſcribing or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of orders to be obſerued, and therewithall deliuering a genuine, true and literall expoſition of the ſame. For although all theſe thinges be abſolutely in the prince, who onely may make lawes &amp;c. and is the direct legifer to all his ſubiects and others liuing within his dominions, or vnder his allegiance any where, as appointed by God himſelfe for that purpoſe: when he ſaid, <hi>Per me reges regnant, &amp; legum conditores iusta diſcernunt:</hi> yet foraſmuch as there is a dependencie of lawes and legifers, one vpon another (as I tolde you before) in the 7. <hi>Quodlibet,</hi> and for that it was ſaid in holy writ of olde, that <hi>Labia ſacerdotum custodient ſapientiam, &amp; legem requires ex ore illius: quia angeli Domini exercituum ſunt:</hi> which wordes expreſſely appointing prieſtes to be expoſitors of lawes, are to be taken as they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Gods honour: and what in conſcience they doe binde vnto how the ſo obliged ſubiects may be diſpenſed withall therein, and how not in any wiſe. Therefore this being the office of the clergie, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane to prince and people, what the law of God and man is, and how farre a temporall prince may goe in making of lawes without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie to the lawe diuine: It followeth, that as their knowledge and experience muſt needes be greater then the Lords temporall in al ſuch caſes, becauſe it is their direct ſtudie: ſo alſo if any booke be to be
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:20192:116"/> written or lawe made, giuen &amp;c. their intereſt vnder their prince is the greateſt and moſt of all other therein: and ſo by conſequent in theſe two caſes the ſecular clergie or ecccleſiaſticall perſons in this ſenſe for inſtruction of others, and by reaſon of their more learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then more temporall perſons orderly haue or commonly can haue: may be ſaid to deale in ſtate matters of what profeſſion ſoeuer they be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as for the ſecular prieſts heere in England, in theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie times of their frownd on ſtate, although they may lawfully deale in the premiſſes: yet muſt it be with a prouiſo (which wanting) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger themſelues and thoſe they liue and conuerſe withall. Yea and bring all other catholikes to be ſuſpected and had in iealouſie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And that is, Firſt, not to take vpon them by word or writing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the parliamentall lawes and ſtatutes made. Secondly, not to controll either peremptorily or otherwiſe, the preſent gouernment of the ſtate. Thirdly, not to impeach the dealings or proceedings of any one of her Maieſties honorable Counſel or high commiſſioners in ſtate affaires. Fourthly, not to meddle directly or indirectly with diſpoſing of the crowne this way, or that way, or appointing out of ſucceſſors thereunto. Fiftly, not and much leſſe, to ſtirre vp further ſtrife (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after will be prooued) that the Ieſuits haue diued too deepe ouer head and eares in all theſe things. Sixtly, but a ſecular prieſts office (being neither of Court nor Counſell) is in theſe caſes onely to admoniſh all good catholikes to beare Chriſt his croſſe with patience. Seuenthly, not to meddle in writing, printing, or procuring the publiſhing of any ſuch booke, libell, or pamphlet, as may mooue, exaſperate, or touch the preſent ſtate in any of theſe points before ſpecified. Eightly, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their office is by the way of mediatorſhip and humble ſute, to procure by all poſſible ſatisfaction (ſtanding firme and inuiolate their function and faith) to her Highneſſe, and thoſe in authoritie vnder her: that thoſe ſharpe penall lawes made againſt innocent and harmeles harts, to the cauſe and ſhedding of much guiltleſſe bloud, that hath beene ſpilt for the Ieſuiticall offences: may either be abated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed by ſome new prouiſo made, or elſe all wholy repealed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentall acte or otherwiſe dealt in, as in her Maieſties wiſedome and high prudence of her honorable Counſell ſhall be thought meeteſt for mitigation of our generall afflictions. Ninthly, and beſides this the ſeculars office is to inſtruct euery catholike what they ought to thinke and what to doe and ſay in theſe caſes if they ſhoulde chance to come before the ciuill magiſtrate. Tenthly, and laſt of all, if any booke be ſet foorth of ſtate: (as thoſe are which concerne ſucceſſion of the crowne, detraction of the preſent gouernment, detection of any publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in authoritie, defamation of the bloud royall of the land, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:20192:117"/> againſt regall maieſtie and the like, or any ſpeech or practiſe for inuaſion of the land, excommunication of our Soueraigne: and getting conſents for aduancement of an alien prince:) to write, acte, ſpeake, or otherwiſe to deale againſt ſuch perſons and their treacherous deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confute their falſe, erronious, and ſeditious bookes of thoſe ſubiects, to conferre or haue intercourſe with the aduerſaries howe to preuent thoſe miſchieues that hang ouer the whole realme. In theſe and all ſuch like caſes may ſeculars ſtatize, that is, deale in ſtate affaires how to preuent miſchieuous ſtatizers, of their purpoſe and practiſes: but no further, and ſo farre onely by conniuence for the good of our common cauſe and ſafetie of our countrey.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, now for the Biſhops and others of the clergie heere in England, they no queſtion repreſenting the eccleſiaſticall ſtate, may deale in moouing, inſtructing, expounding, diuulging or doing any the like acte perteining to prime-membred, numbred, and accounted on ſtate; as much, and ſo farre as the ſame ſtate doth authorize them vnder that title and name to deale in.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the like might be ſaid in ſome ſenſe for the Puritanean Conſiſtorie, repreſenting the eccleſiaſticall ſtate in Scotland, were not that their grounds, rules and principles of their gouernment Ogloger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian (iuſt like to the Ieſuiticall platforme) did vtterly ouerthrowe both ſtates eccleſiaſticall and temporall, and brought both head and members of the body politicall, to be a plebeian hotch potch of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularitie: voide of all name, nurture or nature of any ſtate. And by conſequent the puritanes in England are in the ſame predicament for ſtate matters, that the Ieſuits are in: both nought, vnlawfull, deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and directly to be called ſtatiſts or rather ſtatizers againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate. That this is ſo of the Ieſuits ſhall be treated of in all the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing articles; and for the preſent, that it is none otherwiſe to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Puritanean miniſters: the Conſiſtorian diſcourſes, letters, libels and practiſes of <hi>Knox,</hi> of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> of <hi>Beza,</hi> of <hi>Cartwright,</hi> of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> of <hi>Browne,</hi> of <hi>Field,</hi> of <hi>Gibſon,</hi> of <hi>Dauiſon,</hi> and many others make it manifeſt: nothing being more ordinary then to preſſe England, and to inueigle her Maieſties loyall ſubiects with the examples of Geneua &amp; Scotland. Some fewe of whoſe principles concerning ſtate affaires I will heere ſet downe, as well to giue you to vnderſtand what ſtate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thoſe are, which as vnlawfull, treaſonable, and pernicious, both to prince and ſtate, are forbidden and doe indanger, intangle, and hazard their liues that deale in them: as alſo that therby you may iudge how iuſtly the Puritanes and Ieſuits iumpe togither in ſtatizing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, one and a chiefe principle of the Puritane miniſters is, neuer to let any forme, face, ſhew or name of an eccleſiaſticall ſtate remaine amongſt them: but to obliterate, eradicate, and vtterly extinguiſh the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:20192:117"/> name of Biſhops, and of all auncient eccleſiaſticall perſons of, from the face of the earth. To which effect a Scots miniſter in a letter to his friend ſaith, that certaine of the chiefe noble men of England dealt with him (by inſtigation no doubt of ſome Engliſh miniſters in the yeere 1583.) to perſwade the king of Scotland his maſter to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the Biſhopricks in his countrey, that his proceedings therein might be an example for England adioyning. And ſo within two yeeres vpon repayre of 10000. men in armes to the king of Scots at Sterling, the Biſhopricks being wholy ſuppreſſed in deede one <hi>Knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtub</hi> a Conſiſtorian miniſter of Suffolke wrote thus to <hi>Feild:</hi> I would be glad (quoth he) to heare ſomewhat of the eſtate of Scotland: It doth more trouble me then our owne: For I am conceiuing ſome hope vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the change of their former proceedings. Which hope no doubt was (as <hi>Cartwright</hi> ſaide) that as thoſe turbulent Conſiſtorians had been an example to the church of Fraunce and Scotland to follow them: ſo the Lord (ſaith he the ſaid <hi>Cartwright</hi>) would haue vs alſo to profite and be prouoked by their example, what to do? mary to play the rebels as they had done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another principle (ſet downe in <hi>Whittinghams</hi> preface to <hi>Goodmans</hi> booke) is taken out of <hi>Knox</hi> his doctrine, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that if kings and princes refuſed to reforme religion, the inferior magiſtrate or people, by direction (forſooth) of the miniſterie might lawfully, and ought (if neede required) euen by force and armes to reforme it themſelues. The firſt practiſe of which principle was at Geneua, for abandoning of their lawfull prince the Biſhop of that place. For when they perceiued that the Biſhop ſought by force to encounter their proceedings, and that as <hi>Sleidan</hi> notes) he had excited the Duke of Sauoy to that end to aſſiſt him: they then ioyned themſelues into a more neere amitie with the Bernians, &amp; other neighbouring conſiſtorian ſtates: ſo as the Duke and Biſhop comming together to beſiege the citie were both repulſed <hi>Bernatibus illis auxilium ferentibus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another like principle to this is grounded vpon an oth of confederacie, taken firſt amongſt the followers of <hi>Knox</hi> in Scotland vpon a letter of his written from Diepe in the yeere 1557. by the iudgement (as he ſaith) of the moſt godly and learned that then liued in Europe (meaning <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> and the reſt of the Geneuians.) The effect of which oth, together with a teſtification of their intents made by a kinde of ſubſcription was this: (ſent to the Queene Regent in time of parliament holden by her in Scotland:) that vnles they had their deſires, they would proceede in their courſe for ſuppreſſing of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious houſes in Scotland, agreeing to their order of reformation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be obſerued through all that whole realme, ann. Dom. 1558. whereof a memorable letter was ſent in the name of the people to all
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20192:118"/> the religious houſes: that they ſhould either remooue thence by ſuch a day, or elſe they would then eiect them by force, and to make it ſure on their part: theſe new ſtatiſts enacted before hand, there: that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelues nor any that ioyned with them, ſhould incurre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any danger in life or lands, or other politicall paines: and that if any violence hapned in purſuit of theſe matters, they meaning the Queene and her ſubiects) ſhould thanke themſelues. Whereupon ſhortly after being all put to the harme, and all men vnder paine of rebellion inhibited to aſſiſt them for contemning the Queens ſummon for their apparance at Striueling: they roſe vp preſently in armes at Saint Iohns-towne (excited by <hi>Knox</hi> his preachment, made for that purpoſe, for the ouerthrow of religious houſes) and within two daies had quite deſtroied and raſed the houſes of Blackfriers, of the Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friers, and Charterhouſe monks downe to the ground; and ſo procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Fyfe, Angus, Mernis &amp;c. breaking downe all altars and images: they wrote to the Queene (threatning to deſtroy Saint Iohns-towne for that fact) that vnles ſhe ſtaid from that cruelty, they ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to take the ſword of iuſt defence; proteſting that without the reformation which they deſired, they would neuer be ſubiect to any mortall man. Vpon which occaſion taken, they writ to all their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to repaire vnto them: as alſo to the nobles: vpon paine of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication to ioyne with them, as it being their dutie (ſaid <hi>Knox</hi>) ſo to doe, to bridle the furie and rage of wicked men, were it of princes and emperors: Of like ſort alſo they writ to the Biſhops and clergie (which then were in Scotland) that vnleſſe they deſiſted from dealing againſt them, they would withall force, and power execute iuſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and puniſhment vpon them: and that they would begin that ſame war which God commanded Iſraell to execute againſt the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites. Which exorbitant letters of theirs, tooke ſuch effect with the temporaltie: that when <hi>Lion</hi> Herault in his coate armour commanded all vnder paine of treaſon to repaire to their houſes by publike ſound of trumpet in Glaſco: neuer a man obeied that charge, but went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to their aſſociats at S. Iohn Stow.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this principle and manner of ſtatizing they termed by an other name the reſiſting of the enemie: which to make ſtrong they ſet downe an other principle, by entring into a league by ſolemne oth at their departure from S. Iohns towne, that if any one member of their congregation ſhould be troubled, they ſhould all concurre, aſſiſt and conuent againe together for defence of the ſame. As preſently after they did (vpon a new quarrel pickt againſt the Queen) at S. Andrewes, where by <hi>Knox</hi> his preachment, they made hauocke, caſt downe, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and deſtroied all the frieries and abbies in the towne. And ſo dealt they ſhortly after with the abbie of Scone, the frieries of Striueling, of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20192:118"/> Lithquo, and of Edenborough, whence the Queene being fled for feare, they kept the field two monethes, tooke away the coyning irons (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Queene alledged a portion of the patrimonie of the crowne) and iuſtified the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, vpon this principle followed another for contempt of all authoritie, power and ſoueraigntie in regall maieſtie. Whereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a new league of confederacie, that from thencefoorth they would neuer come at the Queene (though ſhe ſent for them) without conſent of their companie: they animated their faction to be alwaies readie, and to ſtand vpon their guarde. They gaue their Queene the lie diuers times, and vſed her with moſt deſpitefull ſpeeches. They ſawcily termed her part, a faction: (euen iuſt in all things like to the Ieſuiticall proceeding) and renouncing their obedience vnto her, proteſted that whoſoeuer ſhould take her part, ſhould be puniſhed as a traitor, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God ſhould put the ſword of iuſtice into their hands. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with <hi>Wilcocke, Knox,</hi> and other miniſters, for depoſing of the Queene regent from her gouernment: who aſſuring the reſt, that it was lawfull for them ſo to doe: proceſſe was made, ſentence was giuen, and her highnes was depriued of all regiment by a formall act ſet downe in the ſame ſtorie penned by <hi>Knox,</hi> and printed in part after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward here in England.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, another moſt groſſe antiſtatiſticall principle of theirs is: that they of their exorbitant word and authoritie, might call a parliament, and enact what they pleaſed without conſent of king, Queene or other ſtate. Whereupon holding a mocke parliament ann. Dom. 1560. by conſent of the French king and their Queene his wife, they (forſooth) therein reformed religion, and ſet out a confeſſion of the Chriſtian faith: And vpon intelligence giuen to the ſaid king and Queene, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to confirme or ratifie the actes thereof being mooued thereunto, the confederates anſwered: We little (ſaid they) regard it, for all that we did, was rather to ſhew our dutifull obedience, then to beg of them any ſtrength to our religion. And when it was obiected, that it could not be a lawfull parliament, where there was neither ſcepter, crowne, nor ſword borne: They made light of it, ſaying, that theſe were rather pompous and glorious vaine ceremonies, then any ſubſtantiall points of neceſſitie required to a lawfull parliament.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for their principles of practiſe. Now for their doctrine of ſtatizing: the principles are alſo of like condition, whereof theſe are chiefe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Firſt, that reformation of religion belongeth to the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie. Secondly, that the commonaltie by their power may bridle the cruell beaſts (to vſe that beaſt <hi>Knox</hi> his words) the prieſts. Thirdly, that the commonaltie if the king be negligent, may iuſtly prouide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of true preachers, and maintaine and defend them againſt all
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:20192:119"/> that doe perſecute them, and withall deteine the profit of the Church liuings from the other ſort. Fourthly, the commonaltie and nobilitie ought to reforme religion, and in that caſe, may remooue from honor and puniſh ſuch as God hath condemned (he meaneth idolaters in the Deuteronomicall law) of what eſtate, condition or honor ſoeuer. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not birth-right onely nor propinquitie of blood, that maketh a king lawfully to raigne aboue a people profeſſing Chriſt Ieſus. Sixtly, if princes be tyrants againſt God and his truth, their ſubiects are freed from their othes of obedience. Seuenthly, the people are better then their king and of greater authoritie. Eightly, the people haue right to beſtow the crowne at their pleaſure. Ninthly, the making of lawes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the people, and kings are but as Maſters of the Roles <hi>Tabula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum custodes.</hi> Tenthly, the people haue the ſame power ouer the king, that the king hath ouer any one perſon. Eleuenthly, it were good that rewardes were appointed by the people for ſuch as ſhould kill tyrants: as commonly there is for thoſe <hi>qui lupos aut vrſos occiderunt, aut catulos eorum deprehenderunt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Buchan. de iure regni.</hi>) Twelftly, the people may arraigne their princes. Thirteenthly, the miniſters may excommunicate the king. Fourteenthly, he that by excommunication is caſt into hell, is not woorthy to inioy any life vpon earth &amp;c. There are an hundred twiſe told of the like ſtatiſticall principles and practiſes, to be collected out of <hi>Caluine,</hi> of <hi>Beza,</hi> of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> of <hi>Hotaman,</hi> of <hi>Vrſin</hi> (as he commeth out from Newſtad) <hi>vindici contra tyrannos,</hi> and of other puritan miniſters of the conſiſtoriall tribe: fitly agreeing to the Ieſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal platforme in their high councels of reformation and other writings: All which are ſuch matters of ſtate indeed, as no true ſubiect can deale in, allowing of them: but is a ranke traitor for his paines.</p>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20192:119"/> particulars. As firſt for her Maieſtie: it is a preuention of all dangers to her royall perſon, bicauſe hereby a ſingular meanes may in her high wiſedome be vſed, as well to finde out the puritane as the Ieſuiticall faction, as alſo to roote both out of the land by information giuen, and diſcouerie of the one faction on the part of the proteſtants: of the other on the part of the catholikes. Secondly, for the ſtate preſent in generall it giueth an aſſurance: that by no word, writing or other practiſe there can be any thing attempted without their priuitie, bicauſe euery one for their owne indemnitie will be ready to reueale it, and thereby ſtop the impotencie of traitors from ſo attempting, for feare of diſcouerie ere euer it come to acting. Thirdly, to the Lords temporall or ciuill ſtate there cannot come any thing for them to diſlike of, as there being nothing deſired at their hands by the ſeculars and other catholikes, but onely a good word on their poore diſtreſſed countrymens behalfe, to her Maieſtie: that they may be hereafter without feare of loſſe of life, lands or goods, or to be ſackt, ranſackt, pild and polde as by inferior of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers they haue ſometimes hitherto been: And that the penall lawes for paiment of money for their recuſancie may ſo be tempered, as both her loyall catholike ſubiects may be able to liue; her Maieſties cofers more inriched; their ſeruice done with more alacritie to her Highnes in time of neede, and all better appointed and able to performe what they take in hand on her royall perſon and countries behalfe, by this meanes. Fourthly, to the Lords ſpirituall, there can in like ſort no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience grow thereby: for that there is no ſuite either made or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in preiudice of their preſent incumbencie, or hinderance of one farthing they inioy of the ancient catholike church reuenues, or abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one inch of their honor: knowing that the gift of the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes in England as well by ancient catholike, as alſo by recent lawes, are in the prince to beſtow where her Maieſtie pleaſeth: And therfore committing the controuerſie of religion, ſucceſſion and calling to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in points of pacification and humble ſuite for releaſe of affliction, they yeelding to them the honor of Earles or Barons, as their place by gift of the prince doth inueſt them withall: there is no cauſe moouing them, to diſſwade from toleration: but rather in truth, both ſtates and perſons eccleſiaſticall and temporall in reſpect of the premiſſes for the ſafer continuance in their preſent intereſt, may conceiue iuſt cauſe and many weightie reaſons moouing them on the ſeculars and other catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like recuſants behalfe, againſt the Ieſuiticall and puritanian faction, to commence their humble ſuite to her highnes, for libertie of conſcience: with a repeale, or at leaſt a gratious, milde and comfortable mitigation of former ſharpe penall lawes, made aſwel againſt the ſeminarie prieſts themſelues, as alſo againſt all thoſe that receiue or relieue them any manner of way. Fiftly, to the catholike recuſants themſelues there is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20192:120"/> none <hi>ſanae mentis</hi> (vnles bewitched with the Ieſuiticall vaine hope of future aduancements) but may and no doubt but doe and will daily more and more eaſily perceiue it, that this, betwixt the ſeculars and Ieſuits was the happieſt contention that euer roſe: and that all diſcreet, vertuous and ſound catholikes in deede, haue iuſt cauſe (eſpecially if of a naturall, humane breede, and not mungrels, nor baſtards) to giue God thanks euery day vpon their knees, for this ſo ſweete, vnexpected, extraordinarie, comfortable, and to be admired at, meanes to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. <hi>ſcil.</hi> how euer ſuch hart-breaking broiles ſhould haue turned to ſo great a good on all ſides, as doubtleſſe if the diuell play not the knaue too too egregiouſly, and preuaile more then ordinarie, theſe cannot chooſe but turne vnto: Firſt, in receiuing hereby a holeſome <hi>mithridate</hi> or <hi>antidotum</hi> to the ſpirituall health and recouerie of many a deuoute ſoule, againſt the moſt dangerous infections, and by all other meanes irremedileſſe poyſon of the Ieſuiticall doctrine, then by baniſhing out of their mindes this vnſauorie compariſon and diſtinction of perſons in beſtowing of ſpiritual graces, with <hi>ego ſum Pauli, ego Apollo</hi> &amp;c. after that by breeding in euery vertuous, ſincere, religious catholike hart a more reuerend regard to prieſthood in generall, and to their ghoſtly fathers in ſpeciall, then now they haue by the Ieſuiticall policies and moſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiuillian perſwaſions. And laſt of all there would be then, the woonted ioy at meeting of prieſts and catholikes together: whereas now, and ſo long as the Ieſuits remaine in this land, there is none other, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but mutinies, brabbles, detractions, defamations, watchings, intrappings, betrayings of one another, and nothing but a mournefull blacke <hi>ſanctus</hi> in ſteede of a ioyfull <hi>Alleluia</hi> at the conuerſion of any ſoule, or furtherance of any good, catholike, and charitable action.</p>

Secondly, as notwithſtanding their vow of voluntary pouertie they may haue and poſſeſſe lands and all other things in common: ſo may they alſo carry a kind of ſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues: and thereupon being ſubiects alſo to their prince, and members incorporate to the common wealth wherein they liue; their Abbots, Priors, Guardians, and other ſuperiors choſen amongſt them to rule ouer them, may be admitted by the two ſtates eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and temporall to deale in ſecular affaires and matters of ſtate: as other Biſhops and Parſons eccleſiaſticall may, and ſo was the cuſtome of old in this land, that commonly the Abbot of Weſtminſter was Lord Treaſurer of England: the Archbiſhop of Yorke Lord preſident of the North, and ſometimes one Biſhop and other while an other was Lord Chauncellour of the realme. Thirdly, yet was neither this a freedome to the monkes of their cloiſter to liue ſecularly, neither was it allowed of, as generall to all religious orders, to be aduanced ſo: bicauſe ſome are bound by vow to the contrary: and as repugnant to their profeſſion they beare no ſtate amongſt themſelues but liue all in humiliation without poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, lands, or any thing that ſmels of the world ſaue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a houſe to ſhrowde them from cold: a church to ſerue God in, and meate and drinke to keepe life and ſoule together: as of almes ſhalbe giuen them, &amp;c.

                     </note> to make theſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Iles all one Ieſuiticall Monarchy: to infeoffe themſelues by hooke or by crooke in the whole imperiall, dominions of great Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia: with the remainder ouer, to their corporation or puny fathers, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding them, as heires ſpecial in their ſocietie, by a ſtate of perpetuity: putting all the whole blood roiall of England to the formedowne, as but heires general in one predicament together. That this is ſo, and that their wiſh, their hope, their intents in proceeding, their labour in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, their endeuour in perfecting this plot and platforme are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually agreeing, to all of them a like (though the meanes and manner how to effect be different agreeing to their different natures, diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, qualities, and abilities; as ſome to be aulicall, others martiall, others rurall: and againe of thoſe ſome to be actors others prompters, others inuentors, or plotcaſters, &amp;c.) It is cleere by many generall circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:20192:122"/> As that for one, of maintaining the Archprieſts authority (as all the Engliſh Ieſuits doe moſt eagerly): whoſe inſtitutiue iuriſdiction is directly proued to extend to this point and practiſe for their aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the monarchie. Then for the Scots Ieſuites a man would thinke that if any of that ſociety were againſt <hi>Parſons</hi> proceedings they ſhould be the moſt reſolute. But notwithſtanding this (omitting al the reſt) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuing and ſome moſt earneſtly purſuing, auerring, imbracing the ſaid <hi>Parſons</hi> opinion as their ſpeeches to my ſelfe declared when they were afraid I ſhould haue publiſhed my booke in anſwere to his <hi>Doleman</hi> for the ſucceſſion, &amp;c. Yet euen father <hi>Cryton</hi> who onely the Scots king did hope well of, is proued by Maſter <hi>Cicills</hi> booke againſt him to be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as the other on the Spaniards behalfe; and moſt egregiouſly to mocke, flatter, diſſemble and collogue with his natiue Soueraigne. And as for the Ieſuites of other Nations: it may appeere by the ſtate booke of reformation for England drawne out by <hi>Parſons</hi> and the generall of the Ieſuites, <hi>in cuius virtute caeteri operantur,</hi> that they all aime at one marke, and one courſe, and conceiue one and the ſame generall hope to haue England a <hi>Iapponian</hi> Monarchie (as once one tearmed it) or an apiſh Iland of Ieſuites. An other way, their ſtatizing may be taken for their priuate opinions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the next ſucceſſor viz. whom this and that Ieſuite would gladlieſt haue their vmpier, patron, &amp; champion, to fight the field on their behalfe, in bringing the whole realme vnder their ſubiection. And herein bicauſe arrogancie, pride, and ambition, hath ſet them all ſo high on horſeback, as looke what Prince or Noble can goe away with the Engliſh crowne: that ſame, they hope to be the aduancer of him moſt, who moſt did further their pretence, and was the greateſt meanes to worke on their behalfe, to haue them accepted of as Generall of the armie, in that exploit expeditionall againſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land intended. Therefore in regarde hereof, they are queſtionles often at daggers drawing amongſt themſelues, whether ſome Engliſh, or Scots, or Spaniſh, or German Generall ſhould haue the name of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror or Dictator for the time of the conqueſt. The Scots men knowing that if any of their nation ſhould haue the preheminence, then ſhould their <hi>Critons,</hi> their <hi>Gordans</hi> and other Ieſuits of their nation be higheſt promoted: the Engliſh not doubting but that if any of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ſway the ſcepter royall by their meanes, that then their <hi>Parſons,</hi> their <hi>Creſwels,</hi> their <hi>Garnets,</hi> and others ſhould haue the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence ouer the reſt of the Ieſuits: and ſo if a Spaniard had the honor point, then the Ieſuits of Spaine: if the Archduke, then thoſe of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many ſhould be moſt aduanced. And thus ambition and affecting of ſoueraigntie doth ſo tickle them all with vaine and fantaſticall hopes of England, as <hi>quot homines tot ſententiae</hi> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them: for the particular action, by whom it ſhould be chiefly acted. And I verily thinke, the firſt
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20192:122"/> manner of proceeding, as Doctor <hi>Cicill</hi> inſinuates, makes it apparant, that the hot contentions, wranglings, brabbles, and brawlings betwixt father <hi>Parſons</hi> and father <hi>Criton</hi> about the next ſucceſſor, was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely for defeating the Scots title, and aduancing of the Spaniſh: which both (as it ſeemeth by <hi>Critons</hi> ſpeech in Maſter <hi>Cicils</hi> apologie) did ſeeke for. But the queſtion in ſecret betwixt them was; whether it were fitter, to haue the Scots king, or ſome other noble of Scotland preferd as vice-roy vnder the Spaniard, or elſe the Earle of Arundell, or Darby, or Eſſex, or ſome other of the Engliſh nobles (had they title, or had they none) to the Engliſh crowne. And ſo both like traitors againſt their ſoueraignes and countrie, cogd the one with the other in their ambitious aſpires, pretending a beares loue each one to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, for his owne paunch.</p>
                  <p>A third way of the Ieſuits agreement in ſtatizing may be taken, as it is an humor in theſe kinde of men that are ambitious: to be alwaies loth to liue in ſubiection vnder any, or to acknowledge any ſuperior aboue themſelues (though of their owne order, ſocietie or companie) where they liue. And this aſwell in regarde, that they would not be croſſed in their deſignments (for any the leaſt touch of contradiction ſtrikes a proud ſelfe conceited body dead at hart) as alſo for the humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous delight they take in commanding in chiefe, where they liue; though but ouer three or fower perſons at the vttermoſt: for a king of crickets, a bedle of beggers, and a Pigmay captaine in a conqueſt of cranes, will ſtraight driue pride into a conceit of a ſupremacie to be in himſelfe <hi>ſance pere.</hi> And by reaſon of this naturall inclination in moſt of thoſe that are Ieſuits (for amongſt theſe three ſorts of men whereof I told you before, to wit, wiſe, wealthie or worſhipfull onely admitted to be of their ſocietie) there is a great queſtion, which ſhould goe away with the ſoueraigntie, wit, wealth and worſhip being al three incentiues of aſpiring. And you ſhal not finde any that hath ſpirit in him, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he vaunt of obedience (as the onely way to winne others to be obedient vnto him) and doth indeede actually ſubmit himſelfe in all things to his ſuperior Ieſuit appointed ouer him: yet will he ſeeke ſo much as is poſſible to get his necke out of the coller, his head out of the halter, and his vowed obeiſance from vnder the yoke of commandants ouer him, by ſetting foorth himſelfe ſo, as he may ſeeme to be fit either to be a ſtate Counſellor for his grauitie: a prouinciall for his policie: a rector for his gouernment: a courtier for his complements, or an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent for his impudencie. And in all theſe he muſt ſhew himſelfe to haue a buſie ſtirring head full of inuentions, innouations, and nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and ſo comming to aduancement, he is freed in a ſort from ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie controlment. That this is a third cauſe or kinde of ſtatizing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Ieſuits doe mightily diſagree, and are often at open warres by
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:20192:123"/> brawlings, wranglings, contentions and chidings amongſt themſelues, defaming, backbiting, ſlaundering and ſupplanting one an other (to omit what I haue heard of their ciuill broiles, hatred and emulations in other countries: as alſo what hath beene already ſaide out of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> owne writings, and other things handled <hi>obiter</hi> in this treatiſe: eſpecially whiles Doctor <hi>Lewis</hi> Biſhop of Caſſana was viſitor generall to whom I told you before how they put vp complaints againſt one an other) I referre you for this time to one or two treatiſes penned and publiſhed by ſome very learned and graue catholike prieſtes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſhall finde a large diſcouerie of one of theſe Rabbies, ruffling, ſhuffling, flouriſhing iars and iumblings to exempt himſelfe from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolment of any ſuperior: and to be an abſolute ſtateſman paramount, peregall, peremptorie to command all others as actor independent of any, to act all his actions, I meane the great emperor illegitimate, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, abſtract quinteſſence of all coines, coggeries and forgeries, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> the baſtarde of Stockerſey beyond Coſmage in Sommerſetſhire. How cruelly and Machiuillianlike he ouerthrewe the credit of father <hi>Heiwood,</hi> for preſuming forſooth to equall himſelfe with him, at their being together in England: and how flying hence, being loden with the ſpoile of many poore catholikes, he practiſed to be exempted from the checke of the Pariſian prouinciall, vnder pretence forſooth, that the Queene of England had hired certaine perſons to murther him there: and ſince that time hath euer giuen himſelfe to the ſtudie of ſtate matters.</p>
                  <p>This is that famous conqueror, who hath bathed all England by his ſeditious libels in prieſts blood. This is that woorthy excellent, that lies, diſſembles, and equiuocates at euery word. This is that learned counſeler, that muſt rule, ruffe &amp; range through euery ſtate. This is that ſame <hi>Parſons,</hi> whom pope, prince and peere with all true Engliſh harts haue cauſe to hate. This is he of whom his owne generall reported, that he was more troubled with one Engliſh man, then with all the reſt of his ſocietie. This is he of whom Cardinal <hi>Alan</hi> held this opinion, that he was a man very violent, and of an vnquiet ſpirit: and of whom M. <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> (now his darling) ſaid, that his turbulent head and lewd life would be a diſcredit to the catholike cauſe. And in few: the generall conceit of all that euer haue throughly conuerſed with him, is this, that he is of a furious, paſſionate, hot, chollerike, exorbitant working humour, buſie headed, and full of ambition, enuie, pride, rancour, malice, and reuenge: whereunto through his latter Machiuillian practiſes may be added, that he is a moſt diabolicall, vnnaturall, and barbarous butcherly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe vnworthy the name, nay curſed be the howre wherein he had the name of a prieſt, nay of an irreligious parſon, nay of a temporall, lay man Ieſuite, nay of a catholike, nay of a Chriſtian, nay of a humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:20192:123"/> but of a beaſt or a deuill: a violater of all lawes: a contemner of all authority, a ſtaine of humanity, an impoſtume of all corruption, a corrupter of all honeſtie, and a <hi>Monopole</hi> of all miſchiefe. From whom as from the ſource of all our ſorrowes doe daily ebbe, flowe and riſe vp to full floods in bubbles of bloud and teares, new ſpring tides of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh calamities: keeping vs all continually toſſed to and fro vpon the Ocean maine of inceſſant ſadnes: All eies of enemies caſting a greedie looke after the long expected pray, he hath put them in hope of: all our friends bewailing our heady downefall in his plotted intendments: all Engliſh harts irritated by him: our ſoueraignes life often ſought for, our country ſtanding betraied into the enemies hands: our ſelues poore innocent men and women (that be catholikes and ignorant of his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy practiſes and vnnaturall deſignements) haue already felt the ſmart of his wickedneſſe: whileſt he like a faint ſoldier, nay a daſtardly cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard (for neuer expect manhood in <hi>Machiauel,</hi> high prowes in politikes nor valour in vices) and a falſe deceitfull ſhepheard did winde himſelfe out of the bryars and left both vs and Chriſt his flocke to the ſpoile. And would God he had but onely left: for then ſhould we haue found no want of far his betters, there hauing euer bene better then he, for learning, wiſedome, gouernement and all true tokens of vertue, pietie, and religion euen when he was at the beſt: which was at the time of his writing the Reſolution; a very commendable and worthy work in deed, though neither of any ſo high points aboue ordinary capacitie, as to merite him the name of a ſchooleman or yet of any great or profound diuine, being but a plaine poſitiue diſcourſe, and that not of his owne abſolute inuention but taken out of other authors, onely the praiſe being his for well tranſlating of it, cloſe couching and packing it vp together in a very ſmooth ſtile and ſingular good method: wherein truely he was to be commended. But was all this comparable to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> to <hi>Origen,</hi> to <hi>Appollinaris,</hi> and many moe who loſt their good ſpirits by their ſelfe conceits, &amp; he his by his proud ambitious harts aſpires, ſo vnable now to ſpeake or write of any ſpiritual, prieſtly or religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a very reuerend prieſt comming ouer of late told me, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard a meaner ſermon made beyond the ſeas, then he had heard of father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and that his words and writings for edifying or giuing any good inſtruction and ghoſtly counſell, were as barren, bare and far from his former abilities on that behalfe, as if he had been before father <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> the Ieſuit, and now poore <hi>George Parſons</hi> the waiward foole his brother. Thus it is when proud <hi>Nimrods</hi> will preſume to build Babel aboue the welkin: take vpon them to be ſtrong hunters <hi>coram Domino:</hi> and thinke to face it out, that the outward apparance and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite onely may foreſtall, carrie away and preiudicate mens conceits: where the effects diſclaime to the contrary, crying out againſt him:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20192:124"/> that he hath loſt the ſpirit he had through his arrogancie and abuſes of Gods graces. If he be a religious man he is in the number of monaſticks: what hath he then to doe with the world, to cooſen the innocent and heape together this mucke of the molde? If he be a Ieſuit, he hath by profeſſion ſequeſtrated himſelfe from all medling in ſecular affaires: what hath he then to doe with common wealthes titles, ſucceſſions and princes proceedings? If he haue abiured all pompe, maieſtie and glorie here on earth: he is for a church and a cloiſter, not for courts and pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: what hath he then to doe in determining of ſtate matters, to court to monarches, to cap to crownes, to canton kingdomes, and to crowne kings and Queenes, with pamphlets as he pleaſeth.

In few, if a veſtall virgine in time of gentiliſme could not be brought to vtter any curſe, execration, or imprecation againſt an enimie of Rome: bicauſe as ſhe ſaid (in pagan rite) her office was to pacifie not to puniſh, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue not to put downe, and to pray for all, not to perſecute any: then much more ought this to be a chriſtian catholike religious prieſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and charge: then what hath he to doe in <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> with <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes</hi> banner, to ballance his pen with gaſtfull gores of Engliſh blood, or to imbrew a prieſtly hand in princes bowels?

Firſt, that they are of the ſame tenure, and carrie the ſelfe ſame ſenſe with them that the like ſpeech doth in a paſſage of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons</hi> Appendix to the ſucceſſion, fathered alſo vpon the ſaide Cardinall after his death, notwithſtanding that Doctor <hi>Gifford</hi> (one of whoſe bookes no Engliſh Ieſuit of them all is woorthie to carrie after him) hath a letter to ſhew that the ſame diſcourſe was wholly of this <hi>Polypragmons</hi> owne doing, very vnhoneſtly put vpon the dead. But ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards haue euer one dogge tricke or other of the corruption they come of, and ſo hath he for forgerie, cogging, and lying as a notorious a ſigne of a graceleſſe wretch as any in this age. His wordes in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix are theſe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> After a long <hi>circumquaquam locutionem,</hi> of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments infringing all and euery pretenders title borne within this famous iſle, and as long a peroration on the Lady <hi>Infantaes</hi> behalfe: who though all England were Catholicks, and thoſe of the bloud royall, ſo in <hi>eſſe</hi> with all, yet were her title as good as the beſt (ſaith he:) and by conſequent concludes with this bobbe giuen to all our nation: that the gift of the crowne of England was in the oldking Catholiks hands, who perhaps (quoth this patch <hi>Parſons</hi>) may be perſwaded, as alſo his ſonne the now king may be to the like, ſet to giue ouer his claime, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vp his whole intereſt and right thereunto to his daughter <hi>Clara Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia Iſabella,</hi> yeelding her aide for atchieuing of the ſame to her, and ſome ſuch chatholicks Noble as his Maieſtie ſhall thinke fit for a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to a Lady of ſo high parentage. Who being now the Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> late Cardinall &amp;c. if followeth that he is the Peere muſt be our Prince by <hi>Coruester Parſons</hi> deſignements. And ſeeing he there inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates as much, and that the foreſaid Cardinall <hi>Allan</hi> had dealt with the king of Spaine as he would make the world beleeue to that intent and purpoſe: the caſe then and therein is cleere, that this ſame booke here mentioned, and that Appendix were both of <hi>Parſons</hi> owne doing; as birds of one neſt, feather and wing, hatched by the vnnaturall heate of his ambitious hart. Secondly, I obſerue both heere &amp; there: that there was great difficultie and doubts put, in perſwading the king of Spaine to this exploit for the conqueſt of England, and that there was much adoo to draw him vnto it, had not the parties mentioned importuned him to our countries ouerthrow. Thirdly, they account the intended
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20192:126"/> maſſacre of her Maieſtie, and of ſo many thouſands of her good ſubiects as muſt haue died if the Spaniard had preuailed (as before I prooued it vnto you by the words of the Duke of Medina, and other teſtimonies to that purpoſe) a holy and glorious acte, and to haue beene vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of an vnſpeakeable zeale and pietie, &amp;c. Loe Nobles and Gentiles you deere catholikes of both ſexes and all degrees: <hi>Medina</hi> vowes he will ſpare none, be he or ſhe Catholicke, Proteſtant, or whoſoeuer: this booke affirmes the maſſacre intended is an acte of zeale: what caſe are you now in: if your Soueraigne forſake you alſo? and who ſhal, can, or will defend you? if ſhe giue you ouer to the perſecutor? what haue you to ſay in your owne defence to ſaue your liues? if her highnes draw the ſword of iuſtice and lay it vpon you? Truely nothing at all: but ſo many of you as are loyall ſubiects (your religious catholicke conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reſerued, being as innocent, as ignorant of thoſe practiſes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I dare boldly ſpeake it in the worde of a prieſt, many thouſands in England neuer heard of before the publiſhing of theſe <hi>Quodlibets</hi>) might iuſtly haue fed your dying ſoules with hope of <hi>Beati qui perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem patiuntur propter iuſtitiam, quoniam ipſorum eſt regnum caelorum.</hi> But for other hopes you could haue none. Fourthly, the falſe harted <hi>Cateline</hi> inuolueth all the catholicks that were then beyond the ſeas, in that his moſt Turkiſh, Ieſuitiſh, Puritanian, and barbarous deſignements. Fiftly, he intangleth ſuch as receiued ſo great fauors at her Maieſties hands and the ſtate heere: as that where by the lawes they might all haue beene put to death, they were onely baniſhed. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he forceth them to become interceſſors both for the deſtruction of her Highneſſe, and of her kingdome. Sixtly, what iuſt cauſe is heere gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to her Maieſtie and the ſtate, of ſeuere proceeding againſt all ſuch catholicks as were then beyond the ſeas; when they ſhould come home: in that they all ſought and thirſted after the blood of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, <hi>vos iudicate.</hi> But I hope (and in part I know it) that the falſe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Ieſuits pen when he writ thoſe words, did but expreſſe the traito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous harts of himſelfe and ſome fewe of his conſorts: and that he hath moſt egregiouſly belied many. For of the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> and ſundrie others as well of the cleargie as laitie, it is well knowne they were euer moſt oppoſite to thoſe traitorous practiſes: and therefore moſt mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſecuted by <hi>Parſons</hi> and his confederates: notwithſtanding they ſtill helde and do holde out, as loyall Engliſh ſubiects <hi>vſque ad ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> as obedient catholicke children, <hi>vſque ad aras,</hi> and as ſeruiceable in hart to both, God, and man Pope, Prince, and to the catholicke Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church, and the Engliſh common wealth, as ſoule and body in one perſon can affoord, or faith &amp; fealtie: religion and loyaltie: diuine loue, and naturall affection can expect, or demaund at their hands. And for the reſt, if any were ſo ſotted and bewitched with Ieſuitiſme; or infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:20192:126"/> with the Spaniards as I doubt too many were: I wiſh for my owne part, euen from the bottome of my poore but reſolued catholicke loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hart, ſo many of them as remaine obſtinate with <hi>Parſons</hi> in that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall combination, faire and well buried in their graues.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing made the firſt part of the Interrogatory moſt apparant and manifeſt, I wil now proſecute the anſwere to the ſecond, in as briefe and plaine a method as I may. Say then for the preſent (which yet is more then I would willingly put to mainteine the time and our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtate conſidered) that his Holineſſe and the king of Spaine might lawfully haue taken armes againſt her Maieſtie and this her kingdome our natiue land: yet it was ſhamefull part of father <hi>Parſons</hi> &amp; his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to be the contriuers or inſtigators of it: as it is to be prooued by many memorable examples agreeing to this purpoſe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Firſt, out of holy writ it is manifeſt and apparant that the Iebuſites and other inhabitants of the land of beheſt, were permitted there to liue euen after the Iſraelites had obteined the land as their owne ancient inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <hi>ergo</hi> a forreine people of a natiue broode are not to be by Gods lawes ſubiected in their natiue ſoyle by ſtrangers of an alien land. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Gregorius magnus</hi> when he might haue ridde the parts and coaſts of Italy, from the tyranny of the Gothes and other ſauage peo-people, if he would haue intermedled in matters of blood: refuſed ſo to do, accounting it to be a courſe not fitte for a man of his calling to deale in. Thirdly by the lawes, cuſtomes, and practiſe of all kingdomes, ſuch perſons as ſhall machinate and deuiſe to execute ſuch outragious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignements againſt their prince and countrey: haue euer beene iuſtly condemned and deteſted of all honeſt men and good ſubiects: yea, and euen of thoſe ſame princes inuadors or vſurpers, that comming to ſway the ſcepter royall of a kingdome by ſuch meanes: neuer ſuffred ſuch traitors to paſſe vnpuniſhed, nor without the iuſt guerdon of treaſon, <hi>deducere canes ad inferos,</hi> as by ſundry examples in the <hi>Antiperistaſis</hi> to <hi>Parſons Doleman</hi> I haue prooued it true. Fourthly, it had beene <hi>Parſons</hi> dutie, and ſo alſo the dutie of all other prieſts, Ieſuits, and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to haue praied for her Maieſtie and their countrey, and by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to haue ſought the reformation that we all deſire: and not to haue taken this courſe that he did: to flie away like falſe ſhepheards from the flocke of Chriſt, and to become trumpetors of inuaſion, blood, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and deſtruction. Our weapons ought to be ſpirituall: <hi>praeces &amp; lachrymae,</hi> praiers and teares, preaching and ſufferings for Chriſts ſake, according to the practiſe of all vertuous, religious, pious, and catholike prieſts in all ages. I know what father <hi>Parſons</hi> hath written of this point in an other treatiſe of his: but his examples do not warrant him, nor his fellowes to deale in this ſort as he hath done. Fiftly, to rebinde this againe with authoritie of our omnipotent legifer Chriſt Ieſus when the Samaritanes refuſed to receiue Chriſt, did not Saint <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:20192:127"/> ſpeake thus to our Sauiour (and I dare ſay <hi>in verbo ſacerdotis,</hi> with a more ſincere, true, and religious zeale, then euer <hi>Parſons</hi> had in all his practiſes) <hi>Domine vis dicamus vt ignis deſcendat de coelo &amp; conſumat eos:</hi> but Chriſt turning towards them: What ſaid he? mary: <hi>increpauit illos dicens, neſcitis cuius ſpiritus estis.</hi> They thought (as a good catholike no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon this place) that they might haue done as <hi>Elias</hi> did; they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that they were ledde with the ſpirite of zeale, and of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters honour: but indeed <hi>ducebantur ſpiritu vindictae &amp; terreſtri non cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesti.</hi> Sixtly, father <hi>Parſons</hi> and his companions with the reſt of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Ieſuits, taking vpon them to be <hi>viri apoſtolici,</hi> Ieſuitical, or rather Ignatia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apoſtles, who by their calling (forſooth) are to preach through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the world, and ought to be tied to no ſpeciall place longer then they liſt: it ſhould haue beene more agreeable to their dignities and eſtimation, to haue come amongſt vs hither into England, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did name whither ſo euer they went: and by ſignes and woonders to haue conuerted their countrey to the catholike faith: ſeeing they take vpon them a perfection aboue prieſthood, and will be called new Apoſtles illuminats, and extraordinarie Rabbies that haue more neere familiaritie and acquaintance with God then any other. And this had beene apoſtolicall dealing indeed. Mary yet perhaps the caſe may be altered if they can perſwade vs that their founder &amp; firſt father, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene a captaine and a man of warre: had ſome particular illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and priuiledges from heauen, that, although Chriſts Apoſtles proceeded with mildeneſſe and patience, as we reade in the Goſpell their maſter Chriſt did (which was a longer courſe then a Ieſuiticall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is able with patience to endure) yet his the ſaid <hi>Ignatius</hi> diſciples ſhould haue leaue to take a ſhorter way, and that by fire from heauen or hell (if they could) or by any treacherie, cruelty, treaſon, or what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe ſoeuer, ſo it were <hi>propter bonum ſocietatis,</hi> or <hi>ordine ad deum,</hi> they were to omit no oportunitie or villany that might further ſuch their intents. But by their leaues this being a new and ruffinly courſe, neuer heard of for conuerſion of any nation, they muſt ſhew ſome better te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie then either Angel from heauen, or feind from hell can affoord them, or els we wil not beleeue them to be any other then the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Antichriſt as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſorts of Puritans in this their rebellious doctrine. Seuenthly, if father <hi>Parſons</hi> and his fellowes haue any ſuch large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from their founder, (for from Chriſt they haue it not) as that by force thereof they might haue ſollicited the Popes holines and the king of Spaine, by all falſe and ſlanderous ſuggeſtions (as they did) to vndertake that glorious and woorthie acte forſooth: yet conſidering that they only pretend therby the good of their country, &amp; the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the catholike faith, they might haue ſollicited ſome other prince to haue taken in hand that enterpriſe, and not to haue ſought to haue put their prince &amp; country into the hands of the Spaniards: who are at
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:20192:127"/> this day reputed throughout all the world to be the moſt cruell and bloody nation that liueth vpon the earth. The treatiſe of that woorthy Biſhop <hi>Bartholomeus Cuſaus</hi> (a Spaniard borne) dedicated to the laſt king of Spaine, hath laid the Spaniſh proceedings amongſt the weſt Indians ſo plainely out in their colours: how many millions of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, they haue there murthered: and that with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane barbarouſneſſe, and much more then Phalericall cruelty: as vntill they do repent them, and are become a new generation, all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and countries in the world, are to pray at the leaſt to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them. But none could or would (I am perſwaded) ſerue their turnes but the Spaniard; whoſe pride, ambition, and crueltie hath ſo poſſeſſed their harts: as father <hi>Ignatius</hi> was not a righter Spaniard by birth, then our Engliſh Ieſuits are by imitation. Eightly, beſides, by framing themſelues with all trayterous practiſes and fury to aſſiſt and ſet forwrad the Spaniards deſignements: they haue a ſtronger conceit, or rather a ful perſwaſion, that when the king had ſubdued this realme, neither he, his ſonne, or his daughter would make their reſidence heere, (for then the <hi>Infantaes</hi> title, mariage, or placing in the Lowe Countries was not dreamed of) but that this kingdome ſhould haue beene redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a Prouince, and committed to the gouernment of their ſocietie, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to father <hi>Parſons</hi> our pettie Coruine knight, &amp; the reſt of his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie or ſocietie. Which paſſage though it may ſeeme very ſtrait: yet if euer you ſee father <hi>Parſons</hi> booke of intended Reformation, you will finde roome ynough to put in more odious ſtuffe then I haue handled, or am willing to ſmatter my pen withall. And therefote thinke it no maruell if they profeſſe themſelues the very vowed vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals (in effect) of the Spaniard, for I am perſwaded in my conſcience that they haue conſecrated themſelues more deuoutly to aduance the now king of Spaine or his ſiſter to the ſcepter royall of this land: then they haue to promote the catholike faith. Neither make I any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it at all: but that if heereafter any Pope ſhall croſſe the Spaniards plots and purpoſes, (as like inough they may, England and Fraunce with other nations hauing hitherto beene euer, more reſpectiue to the See Apoſtolicke, and taken the defence of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire more faithfully vpon them, then euer Spaine did, till now of late yeeres: which God of his goodneſſe may alter againe, and grant to his church in theſe nations their woonted floriſh) the Ieſuits will haue ſuch a figge in ſtore for his Holineſſe that ſhall do ſo, as no Ruebarbe, Angelica, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate, or other medicine or antidote ſhall expell the venime, poiſon, and infection from his hart: nor any bezar, pearle, golde, or vnicornes horne, long preſerue his life after it. And if there be (as there are) ſhrewd ſuſpitions in Rome concerning the death of two Popes, two Cardinals, and one Biſhop already but for breaking, or rather inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:20192:128"/> to breake the Ieſuits a little of their obſtinate will and vnbridled inſolencie, and onely to reforme them in their order: then no maruaile at their deſignements for England, &amp; much leſſe doubt to be made of: what they would do in ſuch a caſe if it came to canuaſing for a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

               <p>VVHether (ſeeing it is proued that the Spaniſh inuaſion was traiterouſly procured by father <hi>Parſons</hi> means) did he then alſo and ſome others by his procurement, mooue her Maiesties ſubiects to diſobey her highnes, to take armes against her, to ſurpriſe her perſon if they could, and to ioine their forces with the Spaniard <hi>1588.</hi> affirming that it was lawfull for them ſo to doe, or not?

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>THE ANSWERE.</head>
                  <p>THey did ſollicite, ſtir vp and mooue her Maieſties ſubiects, as it is here deduced: we cannot denie it, greater is our greefe. But it was not lawfull for any honeſt man or true catholike borne vnder Engliſh allegiance to haue followed their aduiſe. And this our generall opinion of the ſeculars, is no ſmall comfort vnto many a deuout ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, whoſe tender conſciences haue been by the Ieſuits falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended zeale mightily perplexed a long time with many doubts, as not knowing what to doe in this caſe of obedience to his holines and their ſoueraigne. Therefore I ſay in few: that as concerning the firſt part of this article, it might haue been a ſufficient argument of Maſter <hi>Parſons</hi> hatred both towards her Maieſtie, and towards his natiue countrie to haue ſollicited the pope and the king of Spaine with ſo great importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to haue aſſailed this kingdome with their owne forces: though he and the reſt of his crue, had left her Maieſties ſubiects to haue (at the leaſt) taken their owne courſes (as God ſhould haue mooued their harts) and not haue troubled himſelfe ſo much in perſwading them with great torments of minde (in many) to haue run with him, and ſuch like miſcreants (as he is) into the pit of perdition for companie, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate his inſatiable deſires. But their malice, pride and ambition are ſo infinite in their actiuitie and operation: as there is no miſchiefe or vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, which they will not attempt, to further their moſt ſauage and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh deſignements. It was much, that one (a clergie man, poſſeſſed and ſeduced at that time by the Ieſuits) did iuſtifie the treacherous dealings of certaine Engliſh ſubiects, in betraying the truſt committed vnto them, by her Maieſtie; and therewithall vpon Ieſuiticall perſwaſions,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:20192:128"/> did alſo furthermore exhort others her highnes ſubiects to doe the like. Mary the courſe that was held by them at this time 1588. paſſeth all Gods forbod: as our phraſe is. But yet will the facing Ieſuits ſo face out this matter, as I ſhall not be credited herein, except I make the ſame as cleere, as day at noonetide, when the ſunne is brighteſt. Therefore to lay open the caſe in plaine termes: you ſhall vnderſtand that in the ſaid Declaration and Admonition before mentioned, father <hi>Parſons</hi> in the good Cardinals name (whom he had bewitched) doth ſtretch all his rhetorike to the furtheſt extent, with ſo great arte and cunning, vſed therein: as ſure, great pitie it is, that euer ſo good a wit as his Grace had, ſhould haue been ſo mightily abuſed by that cooſening mate: and that they both were giuen ouer ſo farre at that time, as that they ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſuch good gifts to ſo wicked a purpoſe. For firſt they make their entrance into their diſcourſe with a moſt odious and ſhamefull decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt her Maieſtie: thereby to ſtirre vp her ſubiects harts to contempt of her highnes, and to make her be holden euery where for odious to God, to the world and all men. I will not trouble you with the particulars: but verily I am perſwaded, that Don <hi>Lucifer</hi> the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt fiend in hell could not haue written more ſpitefully. Secondly, they threaten the nobilitie, gentrie, and all the reſt of the inhabitants of this kingdome, with loſſe of all their goods, their lands, their liues, and with damnation beſides; except that preſently vpon the landing of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards they ioyned themſelues and all the forces, men, munition, vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, and whatſoeuer elſe they could make, with that catholike armie (forſooth.) For the words be theſe: <q>If you will auoide (ſay they) the Popes, the kings, and other princes high indignation: let no man of what degree ſoeuer obey, abette, aide, defend or acknowledge her &amp;c. adding, that otherwiſe they ſhould incurre the Angels curſe and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: and be as deepely excommunicated as any: bicauſe that in taking her Maieſties part they ſhould fight againſt God: againſt their lawfull king: againſt their countrie: and that notwithſtanding all they ſhould doe, they ſhould but defend her highnes, booteles to their owne preſent deſtruction and eternall ſhame.</q> Thirdly, after all theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch like threats in a high and militarie ſtile to ſcarre bugs with: then they come to ſome more milde perſwaſions, and promiſe the noble men, that ſo they ioyne with the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> vpon the receit of their Admonition: they will intreate that their whole houſes ſhould not periſh. <hi>Parſons</hi> did inſtigate the good Cardinall, to ſweare by his honor and in the word of a Cardinall: that in the furie of their intended maſſacre, there ſhould as great care be taken of euery catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and penitent perſon as poſſibly could be: and that he was made a Cardinall of purpoſe to be ſent then into England for the ſweete ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of thoſe affaires. Fourthly, other arguments they vſed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:20192:129"/> from the certaintie of the victorie: as that all the proteſtants would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turne their coates, copies, armes, or flie away in feare, and torment of the angell of God proſecuting them: that although none of her Maieſties ſubiects ſhould aſſiſt the Spaniards: yet their owne forces which they brought with them, were ſtrong ynough: their prouiſion ſufficient: their appointment paſſing: that they had more expert cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, then her Maieſtie had good ſoldiers: all reſolute to die in the cauſe which they had vndertaken: that the blood of all the bleſſed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhed in this land, and all the Saints in heauen praied for the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards victorie: that all the vertuous prieſtes of our countrie both at home and abroad, had ſtretched foorth their ſacred hands to the ſame end: that many prieſts were in the campe to ſerue euery ſpiritual mans neceſſitie: that their forces were garded with all Gods holy angels: with Chriſt himſelfe in the ſoueraigne ſacrament: and with the daily moſt holy oblation of Chriſts owne deere body and blood: that the Spaniards being thus aſſiſted with ſo many helpes: though they had been neuer ſo few, they could not looſe: and that her Maieſtie and her aſſiſtants wanting theſe helpe, although they were neuer ſo fierce, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo proud, neuer ſo many, neuer ſo well appointed, yet they could not preuaile: feare you not (ſay they to ſuch as would take their part) they cannot. And thus farre out of their ſaid Ieſuiticall Admonition.</p>
                  <p>Now what ſay you reuerend prieſts and you deere catholikes of all eſtates to this pernitious booke: wherein he would perſwade you that all the prieſts in England and out of it, praied for the heauie deſolation and vtter downfall, ruine, and deſtruction of our natiue countrie, and vs all in very deede. Well, he therein lies falſly: but let him goe. What praiers he and his made, they themſelues know: for our parts, we were happy many of vs, that we neuer ſo much as once dreamed of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But as for the Ieſuits faction what ſay you: was it not time for them to burne this booke? Will not thoſe that eſcaped the fire be an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting monument of their ignominie and ſhame? God hath ſet a brand vpon them for falſe prophets, to be euer hereafter hated and eſchewed. Their bleſſings turned into curſings, and thoſe whom they curſed God did bleſſe. Confuſion and ſhame fell vpon her Maieſties enimies: and the crowne of an incredible victorie hath adorned her head for euer. The contrarie in euery thing fell out, to that which they propheſied. Their valiant captaines fled: their ſtrength, their prouiſion, their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing appointment, and whatſoeuer elſe they had, ſerued not their turnes: their harts were daunted, and the world hath iudged them to haue cried crauen, as the ſpeech is in cocke pits. But that which they ſpeake of diuine aſſiſtants doth trouble me moſt. What will our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aduerſaries ſay, and what may they not ſay: in that an armie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted ſo mightily with angels, with martyrs, with prieſts, with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:20192:129"/> ſacrament, and with the daily ſacrifice, ſhould ſpeede ſo euill? If I had <hi>Elias</hi> ſpirit, aſſuredly the filthie plague of leproſie ſhould neuer leaue them, nor any of their ſocietie, that euer ſhould approoue this their ſo prophane abuſing of thoſe diuine myſteries. Furthermore, in that they ſaid, that all the prieſts abroad and at home, praied for the Spaniards good ſucceſſe. I am perſwaded not any one vnles they were Ieſuited, did ſo: &amp; ſure I am that a great many did rather quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And therefore (as I ſaid before) they lied falſly: yea, many of them at home (as I haue heard ſome of them auow it) knew not of the comming of the armie, till it was ſcattered: and others wiſhed in their harts that the pope and the king of Spaine had not taken that courſe with her Maieſtie. And as for the prieſts that were in the campe, ſuch of them (I doubt not) as were of the Ieſuiticall humor did thruſt themſelues into that bloodie ſeruice headlong. But ſure I am withall, that ſome others, who were of a more milde and catholike ſpirit, were compelled to be in that campe, full ſore againſt their wils; as ſome of them haue often confeſſed as much vnto me, vpon occaſion of ſpeech betwixt vs. Alſo they tell vs of the indignation of certaine princes, that her Maieſties ſubiects ſhould incurre, if they ſhewed not themſelues rebels and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to her highnes, in aſſiſting the Spaniards: as alſo that in taking her Maieſties part they ſhould fight againſt their lawfull king. Who would haue thought that any Ieſuit liuing, nay any ſtrumpet (were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo impudent) could haue put vpon them ſuch braſen foreheads? I am perſwaded, that as many Engliſhmen as ſhould haue ioyned with the Spaniards, the very Spaniards themſelues would afterwardes in their harts haue deteſted them. And then much leſſe, would any prince liuing haue approoued ſuch treacherie and treaſon. And for the lawfull king they ſpeake of: it is too too vile, traiterous and indigne a ſpeech, worthier to be buried in hell, then printed in any booke, head or hart. And therefore to be hartily wiſhed and praied for at Gods hands, that they may neuer liue good day in England or elſewhere being Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men borne, that doe either now or ſhall hereafter, honor or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, any Soueraigne of this kingdome but <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> whileſt God ſhall prolong her daies. Concerning alſo the Cardinals honor and promiſe: alas good man, there was neuer perſon of ſo high a place, more inueigled then he was, by that falſe Ieſuit <hi>Parſons.</hi> It hath beene confeſſed by ſome of the Ieſuits themſelues, in the hearing of ſundry witneſſes, that the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> openly affirmed vpon occaſion of ſpeech, that his ſworde coulde finde no difference (as he thought) betwixt an heretike and a catholike: his buſines was to make a way for his Maſter, which he meant to doe, and intended no leſſe as before is ſaid. And this may ſuffice for that matter of moouing her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties ſubiects to rebellion.</p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:20192:130"/>
                  <p>But I haue runne too long vpon this point: I truſt it appeereth by all that hitherto hath beene ſaid, what <hi>Parſons</hi> and his fellowes drift was in perſwading her Maieſties ſubiects to rebellion, &amp;c. therefore nowe I come to the ſecond part of the article: which is, that no honeſt man might lawfully haue followed their councell. And firſt, if the ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions were abſurd, vntrue, irreligious, and wicked. It followeth, that no man might without ſinne haue yeelded vnto them. Secondly, titles to kingdomes are not impeached, either by the law of nature, or by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Scripture, as you ſhall heare heereafter out of a great Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>propter defectionem à fide: ergo</hi> the dutie of ſubiects doth continue, and is not diſſolued in reſpect of any ſuch defection. Thirdly, <hi>Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozer</hi> was as great an enimie in his time to the church and citie of God as could be imagined, he deſtroied all before him, and led the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple away captiue into Babell. And yet heare what commandements the prophets <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Abacuk</hi> gaue to the Elders, prieſts, prophets, and to all the people that were in captiuitie: and conſider how vnlike they are to father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſpeeches before mentioned. <q>Seeke the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie of that citie whither I haue cauſed you to be caried away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and pray vnto the God of heauen for it. For in the peace thereof ſhall you haue peace. And that woorthy <hi>Abacuk</hi> ſaid further: Praie for the life of <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> king of Babylon, and for the life of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaſar</hi> his ſonne, that their daies may be vpon earth as the daies of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and that God would giue vs ſtrength and lighten our eies, that we may liue vnder the ſhadow of <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> king of Babilon, and vnder the ſhadow of <hi>Balthaſar</hi> his ſonne, and that we may long do them ſeruice and finde fauour in their ſight.</q> Fourthly, the ſame obedience that heere is preſcribed, to theſe wicked kings: did Chriſt himſelfe and his apoſtles preſcribe and practiſe in their times to heatheniſh princes, Emperors and gouernors. Our Sauiour paid tribute both for himſelfe, and Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and gaue a generall commandement to all ſubiects to do the like, both then and for euer after. For ſo I vnderſtand his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars.</hi> Fiftly, and as touching the Apoſtles: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> they are moſt plaine and moſt earneſt that all ſubiects without exception, ſhould ſubmit themſelues vnto the authoritie of thoſe wicked emperors and gouernors that then raigned (in which number <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe was) <hi>propter dominum:</hi> bicauſe it was the will of God that it ſhould be ſo: and that they ſhould obey them not onely for feare, but for conſcience. Sixtly, there is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that carieth ſome pretie ſhewe, which may be framed from a good rule of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines.</hi> It is apparant that the worde of God doth preſcribe obedience to wicked princes: &amp; it is alſo as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the lawes of the church (as in our caſe) do forbid obedience to ſuch princes. Now ſaith the ſaid Cardinal (but in another matter) <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do

And though then they were very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men, and cruell perſecutors many of them: yet they labored ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie earneſtly to ſhew, that by the doctrine of Chriſt himſelfe, of all his holy apoſtles, and the whole church his ſweete ſpouſe: it was the dutie of all Chriſtians, liuing vnder them and being borne their ſubiects, to ſerue and obey them in all their temporall affaires and cauſes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment. <hi>Vectigalia &amp; collectiones, &amp;c.</hi> There are none of your ſubiects (ſaith <hi>Iustinus</hi> to the Emperor) that pay their tributes, cuſtomes, and collections to ſuch officers as you appoint to collect them, ſooner then we do: that be Chriſtians. <hi>Sic inſtituti ſumus:</hi> for we are ſo taught, &amp;c. to giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars.</hi> And againe, <hi>Nos ſolum deum adoramus, &amp; vobis in alijs rebus laeti inſeruimus.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Athenagoras</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Antonius: pro imperio veſtro, &amp;c.</hi> The Chriſtians doe powre out their vowes and praiers to God for your empire: that the ſonne may ſucceed the father, and the empire may long increaſe and flouriſh. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> of like ſort ſaith: we pray with all our harts, that God will grant to all Emperors, a long life, a ſecure empire, an obedient family, valiant armies, a faithfull Senate, honeſt ſubiects, a quiet gouernment, and whatſoeuer is acceptable vnto them. Eightly, but leaſt it ſhould be obiected that there is difference betweene hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then kings and ſuch, as being once true Chriſtians and catholikes: as al Chriſtians are by baptiſme) are apoſtataed out of the church: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though ſubiects are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to obey the firſt ſort, yet it foloweth not, that they, are ſo bound to the ſecond. To this I anſwere, that although the difficultie be cleered in my ſecond reaſon before ſet downe: yet S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhal make the point more manifeſt. <hi>Ordinauit ſic deus eccleſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuam, &amp;c.</hi> God hath ſo ordred his church: as all ordinarie authority and magiſtrates may haue in this world honor done vnto them: <hi>&amp; aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do à melioribus:</hi> and ſometime from their betters. <hi>Contigit tibi, &amp;c.</hi> It hapneth that thou art become a Chriſtian, hauing a maſter: <hi>non ideo Chriſtianus factus es vt dedigneris ſeruire:</hi> thou art not therefore made a Chriſtian that thou ſhouldeſt thinke ſcorne to ſerue thy maſter ſtill. <hi>O quantum &amp;c.</hi> O how much are rich and great men bound vnto Chriſt: who ſo ordereth their families, as if there be in them, a ſeruant that is an infidell, Chriſt doth conuert him: <hi>&amp; non ei dicit:</hi> and doth not ſaie vnto him: ſerue thy maſter no longer: bicauſe now thou knoweſt him, who is indeed thy true Lord and maſter. Yea, but ſuch a ſeruant may ſay: <hi>Indignum est vt iustus &amp; fidelis ſeruiat iniquo &amp; infideli:</hi> It is not meete that a iuſt and faithfull man ſhould ſerue a wicked maſter being an infidell. Whereunto Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwereth: <hi>non hoc ei dixit: ſed

If Chriſt himſelfe the Soueraigne Lord of heauen and earth <hi>ſeruiuit indignis,</hi> did obey wicked rulers: praied for them being perſecutors: <hi>quanto magis:</hi> how much more ought man not to diſdaine to ſerue his Lord and maſter with all his minde, with his whole good will, and with perfect loue: <hi>etiam malo,</hi> though he be a wicked man. <hi>Quod autem dixi de domino, &amp;c.</hi> And what I haue ſaid of the maſter and ſeruant; vnderſtand the ſame of powers and kings, and of all other ſuperiors of this world. Sometimes they are good and feare God: and ſometimes they feare not God. And ſo he commeth to the place which I haue all this while aimed at. <hi>Iulianus extitit infidelis:</hi> and was he not alſo an apoſtata, a wicked man and an idolater? But Chriſtian ſoldiers ſerued the Emperor an Infidell: when they came to a cauſe that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſt his honour, they acknowledged none but him that was from heauen: when he would haue had them to haue ſerued Idols, and haue offred ſacrifice vnto them, they preferred God before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. But when he ſaid vnto them bring foorth your forces: go againſt ſuch a nation, they preſently obeied. They diſtinguiſhed their eternall Lord from their temporall Lord: and yet they were ſubiect vnto their temporall Lord in reſpect of his will: who is their eternall Lord. Thus farre Saint <hi>Augustine:</hi> whereby I truſt it is plaine: that kings are to be obeied by their ſubiects, whether they be wicked perſons, heretikes, apoſtataes, or woorſe if woorſe could be.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all theſe generall reaſons before mentioned; why no good ſubiects ought to giue eare to ſuch traitorous counſellors as <hi>Parſons</hi> and his fellowes were 1588. and ſo ſtill continue: there yet are ſome more particular and more pertinent reſpects, why her Maieſties ſubiects ought not to haue regarded any, or all their ſaid Ieſuiticall perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before mentioned for their ioyning with the Spaniards. Firſt, the excommunication of <hi>Pius</hi> 5. hauing beene procured vpon falſe ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and ſo by ſurreption: it hath euer beene thought by the grauer and more learned prieſts and catholikes in England to haue been void and of no validitie in law from the beginning. And the ſame opinion is held of both the renouations: partly in that a renouation of that which is not, is voide: and partly alſo for that the inſtigations, as <hi>Parſons</hi> hath ſet them downe, are many of them falſe, and all exceeding malicious. Which opinions being true: in what caſe were they, that were anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the firſt excommunication to rebellion 1569. and in what caſe ſhould they haue bene, that ſhould haue followed the Ieſuits councels, 1588? Surely they were, and haue beene traytors both before God and man. Secondly, there are ſo many queſtions of the nullities of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, as it will alwaies be found a very hard matter for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:20192:133"/> to diſcerne when they are ſo farre to regard them, as that with ſafe conſciences they may take vp armes againſt their ſoueraignes: vpon pretence that they are excommunicated. Thirdly, a great vncertaintie riſeth amongſt the ſchoolemen concerning the denouncing of any ſuch excommunication: when it may be thought to be ſo ſufficient, as that the ſubiects of any king are bound to take notice of it. And peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if the matter were well looked into, there was neuer hitherto any ſuch denuntiation of any excommunication againſt her Highneſſe, as by the Canon law it is required. So as in that reſpect, it had beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for her Maieſties ſubiects to haue yeelded to father <hi>Parſons</hi> trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous inticements. Sure I am that many catholiks do not yet beleeue that there was euer any ſuch an excommunication at all: but that it is a meere ſlaunder, deuiſed by our common enimies, to make all catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks odious. Fourthly, I cannot eaſily deuiſe (as matters are nowe a daies handled) how it is poſſible that ſubiects (beſides the former vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeinties) ſhould euer take ſure and infallible notice of any excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication ſaide to be denounced againſt their king, ſo as they may obey it, and with ſafe conſciences diſobey their Soueraigne. It was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſimple or a moſt inſolent conceite of father <hi>Parſons,</hi> or of the good (though maruelouſly abuſed) Cardinall: to thinke, that their bare words, could in any reaſonable mans iudgement be conceiued, to be a ſufficient warrant for Engliſh catholiks to haue armed themſelues againſt her Maieſtie. And for any other authority or warrant of <hi>Xistus</hi> the 5. his renouation of the former excommunication: I neuer yet heard of it. But howſoeuer it were: yet ſure I am, that no other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was to haue beene giuen of it. For after they haue tolde a long and ſpitefull tale in their ſaid declaration and admonition touching the Popes and the king of Spaines deſignements againſt her Maieſtie: they vſe theſe words, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Of whoſe proceedings in this action: and as well of his holineſſe as his maieſties intention and meaning therein: we are to aduertiſe you all by theſe preſents. And againe. Be it notified to the inhabitants of that countrey &amp;c. Likewiſe be it knowne that the intention of his holineſſe, &amp;c. Moreouer be it knowne by theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents: that it ſhall not onely bee lawfull for any perſon publike or priuate to arreſt (the Queene) but alſo be held for very good ſeruice, &amp;c. Heere we heare of nothing, that his holineſſe ſaith or commandeth in his owne name, vnder his paſtorall and authentike ſeale: but the credite of theſe two men, ſhould haue carried her Maieſties ſubiects to the moſt infamous and inconuenient action that euer hapned in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome. Whereas in good faith, to ſpeake my conſcience: the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall ſtanding ſo bewitched with that Machiuilean Ieſuite <hi>Parſons,</hi> and they writing thus much both together; their teſtimonies ought not to haue mooued any man to a much leſſe miſchiefe then this had beene.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:20192:134"/> Some late experience we haue had as touching our Archprieſt, how boldly ſome Cardinals will aduenture to abuſe the See apoſtolike: and the ſacred diſpoſition of the Popes holines, to ſerue their owne turnes therewith. Yea was not all the whole conſiſtorie and Cardinals of his holines palace, vnles it were two, moſt bitterly bent againſt S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of Canterburie. Inſomuch as finding him at dinner with a capon on Saint <hi>Markes</hi> day, they would haue deliuered him vp, as a lollard: had not God bewraied their malice, by a miracle in defence of the holy and innocent man and bleſſed prelate: turning the capon into a carpe: to ſhew, that his weakenes was the cauſe of breaking the Churches or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for abſtinence from fleſh that day. Whereupon followed that in that ſtreete at Rome and here in England, within the biſhopricke of Canterbury euer ſince, it hath beene diſpenſed withall, to eate fleſh as lawfully vpon that day, as any other. So as you ſee how the Pope his holines, may and often is mightily deluded, abuſed, and preiudiced by falſe informations of ſome particular perſons, and that thereupon (as I haue told you before) he may erre as a priuate man, in not knowing the caſe aright, and by conſequent excommunicate, ſuſpend &amp;c. wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: which although catholikes are bound to obey in ſome caſes (as before is ſaid) that may concerne their ſpirituall puniſhments, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing them for a time of the ſacraments of Gods Church: yet can I neuer finde that it ſtaid any from their temporall allegeance to their Soueraigne, or withdrew them that otherwiſe were loyall ſubiects from defence of their natiue countrey againſt any whoſoeuer: Nay in the caſe propoſed, conſidering the tickliſh eſtate of things as now they ſtand, and what danger catholikes are in on euery ſide: adding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Ieſuiticall humor; I ſay then (to proceede a little further) that although the Popes owne Bull had beene ſo, and to haue beene it ſelfe publiſhed in the moſt authenticall manner that might haue beene well deuiſed: yet ſuch is the falſhood of the Ieſuits, and ſuch is their fauour in Rome, and ſo ſhamefully they dare preſume to informe his holines: as certainly it had been no ſufficient warrant for her Maieſties ſubiects to haue entred into that courſe, which father <hi>Parſons</hi> mooued them vnto. And except thoſe falſe hypocrites be kept in more awe and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from daring to intermeddle with his holines actions in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of matters of ſo important, waighty and dangerous conſequences: the authoritie of the Court of Rome will be greatly preiudiced in their proceedings, and they will not let his holines be in quiet till they haue ſet him at a iarre with his beſt and moſt faithfull ſubiects and ſeruants in Chriſtendome: as we ſee in part already by their indeuouring to bring into diſgrace the whole clergie, ſecular prieſts, religious orders, biſhops and all; that they themſelues may liue at riot and rule, range and raigne at their pleaſures. Fiftly, to confirme then the premiſes, I
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:20192:134"/> ſay then, that let the renouation be as it was, and father <hi>Parſons</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions goe as they are: yet the very lawe agreed vpon amongſt all our Canoniſts doth allow the ſeruants or ſubiects of any Lord or king ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated to performe in fiue caſes their duties and allegeance vnto them: nay they are bound vnto it. <hi>Haec anathema faciunt ne poſſit obeſſe: vtile, lex, humile, res ignorata, neceſſe.</hi> Firſt, if their ſeruice be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for their Lords or for themſelues. Secondly, the very law of nature (I thinke) doth allow ſuch duties: as of the wife to her husband excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated: and the ſame reaſon is of the ſeruant to his maſter, or the ſubiect to his prince. Thirdly, excommunication doth not deliuer a ſeruant or a ſubiect from his former condition: it finding him in the ſtate of a ſubiect or ſeruant, doth not debarre him from doing his dutie. Fourthly, if the ſubiect doe not know that his ſoueraigne is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, then is not he thereby either infected or affected: and of the vncerteintie of any ſuch knowledge, you haue heard before. Nay though the ſubiects doe know it neuer ſo aſſuredly: yet any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer three caſes doe ſerue their turnes for the continuance of their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance. Fiftly, but that which followeth, <hi>neceſſe:</hi> neceſſitie is without all exception, as the ſaying is, <hi>neceſſitas non habet legem,</hi> though the Pope ſhould attempt in perſon any thing againſt any prince or king, vnder what pretence ſoeuer: yet neceſſitie will alwaies excuſe their ſubiects for not obeying his holines buls in temporall duties: and for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their ſaid duties and ſeruices vnto their ſoueraignes. The Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe make ſundry kindes of neceſſities: as <hi>neceſſitas adeſſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter: &amp; adeſſe ſecundum quid &amp; ad bene eſſe</hi> &amp;c. which I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you withall.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall ſee the very point it ſelfe ſet downe in expreſſe termes, concerning the catholikes of England that liue at this day vnder her Maieſtie. The faithfull of England and Saxonie (ſaith <hi>Bannes</hi>) are to be excuſed: <hi>qui ſe non eximant à potestate ſuperiorum, nec bellum contra illos gerunt, quoniam communiter non habent facultatem ad haec bella gerenda contra principes, &amp; imminent illis grauia pericula:</hi> who doe not exempt themſelues from the power of their ſuperiors, nor beare armes againſt them: bicauſe generally they haue no abilitie to wage ſuch wars againſt their princes, and great danger doth hang ouer their heads if they ſhould attempt it. And a little before he ſaith: that ſubiects are not bound to warre againſt their ſoueraigne, or to exempt themſelues from their ſubiection <hi>cum periculo mortis &amp; amiſſione bonorum:</hi> with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their liues, and loſſe of their goods: and ſo endeth his reſolution with an <hi>&amp; caetera:</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, there are alſo many other ſuch like exceptions to be allowed of. And <hi>G. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alencia</hi> agreeth with <hi>Bannes.</hi> For (ſaith he) when the Popes holines doth abſolue ſubiects from their othes of allegiance, that they may not be bound to performe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:20192:135"/> their duties to their Lords that are excommunicated, and doe forbid them likewiſe ſo to doe: they are thus to be vnderſtood, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that they are not otherwiſe bound to obey them in thoſe caſes: but <hi>ſi nimirum negare obſequium dominis ſuis poſſint abſque notabili ſuo detrimento: ita enim hoc est intelligendum, ſicut recte notauit Bannes:</hi> that is, When they may refuſe to obey their Lords and maſters without any notable hurt or loſſe to themſelues: for ſo theſe kindes of abſolutions and forbiddings are to be vnderſtood, as <hi>Bannes</hi> hath well obſerued. And Maſter <hi>Parſons</hi> of his goodnes ſtriketh this matter dead. For in his ſaid Admonition he is pleaſed to tell the catholikes of England and all other her Maieſties ſubiects in theſe words following: that in caſes of euident danger the cenſures of the Church, ſo farre as they concerne onely temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by the meaning of him that gaue the ſentence, doe not binde. Now it might peraduenture prooue a very probable poſition as the world ſtandeth at a gaze: whether it may eaſily be conceiued by a man of a dull conceit that any king will be euer ſo negligent or careleſſe of his owne eſtate: or if he ſhould, whether any counſellors of any kingdome will euer be ſo improuident for the ſafetie of their ſoueraignes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, kingdome and life: as that it ſhall not alwaies be dangerous for their ſubiects to rebell, and take armes againſt them. And then euery man may ſee what followeth: that as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaid, <hi>Multa mihi licita ſunt, quae tamen non expediunt:</hi> ſo queſtionles I am of that minde, that it will not be expedient for the Popes holines to intermeddle with the excommunicating of princes in theſe daies. For aſſuredly it wil ſeldome fall out (if euer) that ſubiects without danger ſhall be able by rebellion to put ſuch a ſentence in execution: beſides the incertainties before ſpecified, that it cannot well be imagined how they ſhould in theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times take ſufficient notice of it, when ſo great and generall a iealouſie on the one ſide is had of all princes, and ſo manifeſt ſignes of intollerable abuſes, falſhood, and malepertnes on the other ſide in the Ieſuiticall faction, to procure whatſoeuer may ſerue their owne turnes for the time without all or any reſpect had of God or man, Pope or prince, church or common wealth, catholike or heretike. And ſure it cannot be but that all princes as well ſpirituall as temporall, will more narrowly looke into the Ieſuits doings then heretofore they haue: when they ſhall duly conſider what daunger they all do ſtand in (yea euen thoſe that now fauour theſe ſeditious buſie headed bodies moſt) if theſe factious companions may procure excommunications at their pleaſure and prouoke his holines to ſtrike with eccleſiaſticall cenſure whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer offendeth any of them, nay whoſoeuer doth not pleaſe and content them in all things: nay more, whoſoeuer hath that which they haue a minde to, and that they cannot otherwiſe haue their wiſh and vnlawful deſire: out goeth a ſlaunder, that he or ſhe are of lewd demeanour not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:20192:135"/> eſtabliſhed in the grace of God; and in few, are reprobates, of God forſaken, and then ſtraightwaies muſt his holines ſtrike them with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication &amp;c. or elſe ſhall he alſo be holden for a Lutheran or fautor of wicked perſons and heretikes.</p>
                  <p>In confirmation of the premiſes: here it offereth it ſelfe fitly to this purpoſe: what father <hi>Criton</hi> the great Scots ſtatiſt ſaid to an honorable perſon in talke of theſe matters concerning the excommunication of his Maieſtie king <hi>Iames.</hi> This noble Lord hauing heard ſome ſpeeches againſt the Scots king blowne abroad by fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> his vnder Agents at Bruxels (ſuch be like as that baſe fellow <hi>Verstegen,</hi> who hauing no more gentlemans blood in his body then in a coupers ſon, nor ſcant ſo much of ſuch a breed may the couper be) yet tooke vpon him to cotize our Engliſh nobles and gentles there, affirming that there were not paſt three or fower in thoſe coaſtes of all our nation that were of any noble or generous blood, coate armour, and anceſtrie, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Earle of Weſtmerland, the Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> and as I remember, the next was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or ſir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> I know not whether: but either ſir knight or ſir knaue was in the third place. Whereupon followed a fowle adoe in the Flemmiſh court for a while, ſundry of noble and generous blood, being mightily diſgraced by this baſe companions information giuen to the prince in derogation to our Engliſh gentrie. And this vntriall gentleman was one of that nobleman father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſpies, intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and blazoners of what infamies as were to be conueyed thence abroad into Italie, Spaine, Fraunce, and other countries adioyning. Amongſt other things that might be thought to indanger his royall perſon moſt: one paſſage was this; that father <hi>Parſons</hi> with others of the zealous illuminates and more reſolute, wiſe, religious, learned and graue fathers and other catholikes had dealt very ſeriouſly with the Popes holines about excommunicating of the ſaid king: which was expected euery hower to come foorth and to be promulgated againſt his highnes &amp;c. Whereof the foreſaid Lord being deſirous to knowe of father <hi>Criton</hi> whether any ſuch thing were or not, and withall whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his owne ſubiects or others that wiſhed well vnto him might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defend his rightfull title or no, he being by father <hi>Parſons</hi> defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſentence denounced an obſtinate heretike: and one of whom there was no poſſibilitie or hope of reclaiming from his hereticall opinions: the ſaid father <hi>Criton</hi> anſwered, ſaying: My Lord, doubt you nothing thereof, it is but father <hi>Parſons</hi> deuiſe to indanger his Maieſties perſon thereby: knowing that the Scots are a falſe, traiterous and a rebellious people: quickly taking occaſion to murther or otherwiſe riſe in armes againſt their liege Lord and king. True it is indeede that father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and other Engliſh Ieſuits, and thoſe that are of the Spaniſh faction haue laboured it much, to haue the ſentence denounced againſt his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:20192:136"/> Maieſtie: but hitherto they haue not preuailed, neither doe I thinke that euer you ſhal ſee it, bicauſe no Scots wil ſeeke for it. And Popes are alwaies ſparing, vnleſſe they be mightily importuned &amp; vrged, as both <hi>Pius quintus</hi> and <hi>Xistus quintus</hi> were by father <hi>Parſons</hi> and other Ieſuits procurement againſt our owne Soueraigne and Queene. Loe what euill hap England had to breede this wicked Ieſuiticall broode, that ſeeke their princes and countries deſtruction, more egarly then any other Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits doe the nations and countrie where they liue.</p>

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>THE ANSWERE.</head>
                  <p>VEry well ſaid Saint <hi>Paule</hi> (as earſt I noted) <hi>Multa mihi licita ſunt, ſed non omnia expediunt.</hi> For it is one thing to talke of the power, authoritie, and lawfulnes of excommunications: and an other of the time, place and perſons when the ſentence is denounced: therefore as we ſay, <hi>ex effectibus cognoſcitur cauſa;</hi> ſo by demonſtration <hi>à posteriori,</hi> it is manifeſt to all our woes that excommunicating of princes is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient in this irreligious and moſt vnfortunate age. Neither did they wel that either ſtirred vp <hi>Pius quintus</hi> firſt to excommunicate her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or theſe that ſince haue vrged other Popes to renew the ſame: And therefore in anſwere to both the points of this article, I hold the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. And for the firſt, theſe are my reaſons. Firſt, when Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> excommunicated the emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> it was a time of greater zeale: and otherwiſe Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> might thereby haue procured vnſpeakable detriment to the Church. In my priuate cogitations here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I haue aſſuredly often doubted whether Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> deſerued more commendation for his prouidencie in attempting ſuch a matter: or the emperor for his patience and obedience in taking the ſame in ſo good part. But yet I hold it out of all queſtion, that if Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had inſerted any ſuch clauſes into the ſaid excommunication, as of latter times are vſed, and ſhould in plaine terms haue depoſed him, or labored to haue had him depoſed from his empire, or abſolued his ſubiects from their obedience: the emperor would haue ſtartled: and I cannot tell, but by all likelyhood he would not haue obeied it, but rather haue put
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:20192:136"/> all to the ſword, that ſhould haue withdrawne themſelues from vnder his allegiance. Secondly, I finde certaine words in Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> which make me to maruell, in that he ſaith out of the gloſſe: that <hi>Princeps &amp; multitudo non est excommunicanda:</hi> or as <hi>Rich. de Media Villa</hi> alledgeth the place, neither the multitude nor the prince ought to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated. And the moſt of the Schoolemen that write vpon S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in this place, doe agree with him: that a multitude is not to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, or if it be, ſome hold that ſuch an excommunication is void. But let it be their error, yet ſtill they omit therein the other part as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching kings and princes, and doe ſay nothing concerning the validitie of it in that place: onely the ſaid <hi>Richardus de Media Villa</hi> doth touch this point ſomewhat to our purpoſe, for the inconueniencie thereof; but in mine opinion very weakely: for that any thing be it neuer ſo plaine may eaſily be ſo auoided. A king (ſaith S. <hi>Thomas</hi>) ought not to be excommunicated: that is (ſaith <hi>Richardus</hi>) but in <hi>maioribus peccatis:</hi> for great offences. As if we ſhould thinke that euer S. <hi>Thomas</hi> thought ſo meanely of the wiſedome, iudgement and diſcretion of the Church: that ſhe would excommunicate princes for euery trifle. Nay if that ſhould be his meaning, he had alledged the ſaid place very ridiculouſly: which is farre from Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> courſe and practiſe. Thirdly, beſides whereas ſome inconueniences are made the impediments why a multitude may not be excommunicated, there may very many moe reaſons of miſchiefes be obiected that doe enſue by the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of princes, which conſequently ſhould ſtay that courſe likewiſe againſt them. I haue proſecuted this reaſon onely <hi>diſputatiuè non poſitiuè, ſaluo ſemper meliori iudicio:</hi> let S. <hi>Thomas</hi> meaning be what it ſhall: his words are as I haue alledged them here in this place. Fourthly, it is no good prouidence in S. <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement to excommunicate thoſe that haue many followers to take their part: or when the ſame may breede a ſchiſme. But it is very likely that kings and princes wil alwaies haue many followers to take their parts, and that the ſame may beget more then a ſchiſme. Fiftly, there was no probabilitie of any good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe that could be looked for by excommunicating her Maieſtie, as by experience might haue beene apparant, by the excommunication de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt king <hi>Henry</hi> 8. Sixtly, I haue made mention before of inconueniences and miſchiefes: but if they may ſerue the turne to ſhew the inconuenience of an excommunication againſt kings, and that I ſhould enter into the enumeration of all the inconueniences and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes; which haue been the effects of both the ſaid excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt her Maieſtie and againſt her royall father: it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere, that there was neuer any excommunication more inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and I ſhould be exceeding tedious. It may be ſufficient that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member vnto you as touching our own time, how thereby her Maieſty
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:20192:137"/> and the ſtate haue been more incenſed both againſt the See of Rome, and likewiſe againſt all catholikes; prieſtes are become moſt odious; the generall cauſe hath beene more impaired; many dangerous que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and ſtraight examinations haue thereof proceeded: and to omit the reſt, infinite perplexities and quidities haue growne concerning the conſciences of the weaker ſort of catholikes, when, wherein, and how farre they might profeſſe their allegiance: which haue intangled them diuerſly, and brought many of them into bands and other great dangers. Seuenthly, I am fully perſwaded, that there was yet neuer any Pope that did euer excommunicate any king or ſoueraigne prince, but that afterward he ſawe cauſe for the moſt part in his owne time (if he liued any while) to repent him of it, and wiſh either it had been vndone or in this or that manner, otherwiſe then it was denounced and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
                  <p>That which hitherto I haue ſaid of the firſt point of this article, doth in ſome ſort confirme my aſſertion concerning the ſecond. For if the excommunication of kings be inconuenient, then what ſhal we thinke of thoſe men being ſubiects, &amp; in times ſo dangerous, as neuer any were more then we now liue in, that did ſeeke either to procure the ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication againſt her Maieſtie, or to renew it. As touching the firſt procurers of it, were it D. <hi>Harding,</hi> D. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> D. <hi>Morton,</hi> D. <hi>Webbe,</hi> all or any of them: they were yet by their leaues (with reuerend regard to their prieſthood and doctorſhip be it ſpoken) but ſimple men out of their poſitiue diuinitie, and did mightily ouerſhoote themſelues in it diuers waies. Firſt, there being a raſh affection or zeale (if you will haue it ſo called) in ſome of the catholike Biſhops when her Maieſtie began to raigne, to haue imitated Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> by excommunicating her highnes and diuers others: yet (as Maſter <hi>Saunders</hi> noteth) <hi>prudentiores Epiſcopi, vel certe manſuetiores:</hi> The wiſer ſort of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or ſurely the milder were of another opinion, and preuailed. Indeede he further ſaith: that they altogether thought it meete to referre the conſideration of that matter to the Popes wiſedome, to doe therein as he thought conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: but it appeereth not, that they did afterwards ſollicite his holines thereunto. But the contrarie will eaſily be prooued, by ſome that are aliue, who can teſtifie that they were farre from that minde, eſpecially afterwards, when they had better conſidered what was likely to enſue if any ſuch excommunication ſhould be procured. And it will likewiſe be iuſtified ſufficiently, that Biſhop <hi>Watſon</hi> was exceedingly grieued, when he heard that <hi>Pius quintus</hi> had been drawne to that courſe: as in his wiſedome ſeeing the great inconuenience of it. Secondly, the ſame reaſons ought to haue hindered the ſaid <hi>Parſons</hi> and any other from ſolliciting the Pope to that cenſure, which mooued thoſe catholike Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to forbeare it themſelues. They conſidered (ſaith M. <hi>Saunders</hi>)
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:20192:137"/> that they were the Queenes ſubiects, and that ſuch a fact might perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture haue procured ſome tumult and ſcandall, and trouble of the whole Eccleſiaſticall ſtate and order: and alſo might probably haue ſtirred vp ſome perſecution. Thirdly, if it were true that ſome Ieſuites haue lately written (but with great Machiuillian ſleights to curry fauor for the better furtherance of ſundry their intended miſchieuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignements) that her Maieſty was in effect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to take the courſe for the alteration of religion that ſhe did, when ſhe came firſt to the crowne: then dealt they therein contrarie to the reaſonable conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſundry canons of the Church, and conſequently very raſhly and vniuſtly. Fourthly, it may be gathered (as I ſuppoſe) out of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> by his dutie to the emperour otherwiſe ſignified, that it was farre from his hart to thinke of the depoſing of him from the empire, or of abſoluing his ſubiects from their obedience, if the emperor had withſtood him. But theſe men were of another humor: they knew that their ſute to <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> did tend to her highnes depoſition from the crowne (ſo far as the Bull would reach) and to the raiſing vp of ſuch a garboyle in the kingdome, as any true catholike hart may iuſtly quake to thinke of it. Fiftly, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> (as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> obſerueth) would not <hi>praecipitare ſententiam:</hi> whether is woorſe a catholike of an euill life, or an heretike againſt whoſe conuerſation no iuſt exception may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Now it is well knowne to all the world, and acknowledged in Spaine, what manner of perſon a certaine king was that once bare a great ſway there: and with how many moſt notorious and hainous enormities he might truly haue beene charged: but yet the Spaniſh Ieſuits and catholikes were farre from the violent humor of our men: they did neuer preſume or once indeuor to ſeeke or ſue to haue their ſoueraigne excommunicated. Whoſe example of forbearance therein, doth argue the inconſiderate raſhnes of our ſaid Ieſuited catholiks and Ieſuits: that haue dealt in ſuch ſort as all the world ſeeth, with her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. Sixtly, whereas diuers kings and abſolute princes haue reiected the authoritie of the See Apoſtolike, as well as her highnes, and doe ſtill ſo perſeuere: yet we finde not that any hitherto of their ſubiects, prieſts, Ieſuits, or what other ſoeuer, haue ſought their ouerthrow, depoſition and deſtruction, as our Engliſh Ieſuits by profeſſion, and ſome other prieſts in affection and faction Ieſuited haue ſought for. It is true that in Fraunce there are publike monuments of Ieſuiticall tyrannie. For firſt they procured <hi>Henry</hi> the third to be excommunicated; and then by degrees they murthered him. The like courſe they alſo held for a long time with the king now regnant, ſauing that to their intollerable greefe, the blowe which they procured to be giuen him prooued not mortall: though ſtill their malice and hatred towards him, appeereth manifeſtly to be as extreme as euer it was, and therefore their good
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:20192:138"/> wils to be conſidered of accordingly. For all which and many moe moſt traiterous practiſes, the Ieſuits are at this day an odious and deteſtable generation in that kingdome, and with great prouidence and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are baniſhed thence for euer. Whereby we may ſee what all ſuch perſons doe deſerue, who haue amongſt vs proſecuted her highnes with little leſſe malice and treaſon, in ſeeking to haue her Maieſtie excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, which is made by ſuch miſcreants, but an entrance to all further diſloyaltie, crueltie and miſchiefe. Seuenthly, it is apparant by the iudgement of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that when excommunication cannot be denounced againſt any, but with the inconueniences that are in the point before touched, and are therefore in ſuch caſes to be forborne: thoſe counſellors that ſhall notwithſtanding ſollicite and labor for to procure any ſuch excommunications, are to be vtterly reiected and condemned, as being perſons whoſe counſels are <hi>inania, pernitioſa atque ſacrilega, quia &amp; impia &amp; ſuperba ſunt, &amp; plus turbant infirmos bonos, quam corrigunt animoſos malos:</hi> vaine, pernitious and ſacrilegious, bicauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked and proud counſels, they bring greater trouble to weake good men, then amendment to thoſe that are euill and ſtoute. For in ſuch caſes he ſaith, that thoſe things muſt be borne with patiently, that cannot be reformed, without the ſaid inconueniences: and that it is the dutie of good men in the meane while <hi>cum dilectione</hi> with loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to mourne and lament, and not to take ſuch deſperate and wicked courſes againſt all dutie, faith and allegiance, as theſe men we ſpeake of did, and our Machiuillian Ieſuits doe ſtill purſue and indeuour. Eightly, wheras exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication is termed by the learned ſort of catholikes <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina,</hi> a medicine, that is, ſuch a cenſure as tendeth to reforme the party cenſured: this their traiterous indeuour (for I can terme it no better) aimed at nothing but blood, crueltie and deſtruction, not onely of their ſoueraigne, but an infinite number beſides. For they could not be ſo abſurd as to thinke, that the ſaid excommunication was euer like to take effect, without either warre or treacherie. Nay it is now plaine, that they had then plotted in their harts a ſhamefull rebellion, which they did ſollicite, ſome of them in perſon, as ſoone as the Pope had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied their deſire. Ninthly, it is well knowne that the chiefe reaſons that mooued <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> to yeeld vnto them, were moſt falſly &amp; ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptiouſly ſuggeſted to his holines, and carried with them very many abſurdities, as this for one, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Forſooth the Duke of Norfolke was a moſt ſound catholike, (which was falſe:) all the realme would follow him, (which was abſurd:) the Popes pleaſure and cenſure once knowne to the catholikes, there could be no reſiſtance, (which was ridiculous.) Beſides this, a mariage would follow, that would reforme all and worke woonders: as if they ſhould haue ſaid, that when the skie falleth, they ſhould haue ſtore of larkes.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:20192:138"/>
                  <p>And now to thoſe that procured the renouation of this excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at the times articulated. If the firſt procurers of it may iuſtly be condemned as you haue heard: what ſhall we thinke of them (father <hi>Parſons</hi> and his aſſociates our pretended holy fathers of the ſocietie of Ieſus) that when it lay aſleepe did reuiue it? Certainly they are to be deteſted of all true catholikes and dutifull ſubiects to her Maieſtie.</p>
                  <p>All that hitherto hath beene ſaid againſt the procurers doth touch them nearer, that were the ſollicitors to haue it renewed: as it may appeere (to any that is not obſtinately wilfull) for theſe two reaſons. Firſt, for that they did finde by experience the miſchiefe which the other might eaſily haue foreſeene, that is, all the plagues, miſeries, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and inconueniences that the denouncing of the ſaid excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication had already wrought: which ought to haue reſtrained their madnes, conſidering that the renewing of it could not chooſe in any reaſonable mans iudgement but prouoke her Maieſtie and the ſtate to greater ſeueritie againſt all catholikes: whereof they were in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger themſelues, being beyond the ſeas. Then a ſecond reaſon, was the bad ſucceſſe, which they alſo might haue noted by all the attempts made, giuen or intended againſt our ſoueraigne &amp; realme, apparantly demonſtrating thus much at leaſt to be expected by renewing of the excommunication: <hi>ſcil.</hi> a ſorrowfull repentance of their after wits too late: right Engliſhmen in deede, but no way to be wiſhed for ſuch experimentall knowledge of our natiue diſpoſitions in matters of ſo great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as in a world greater could not be found. And howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer any cauſe had bin giuen, yet the caſe was cleere by the effects en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, that it was not Gods will ſuch excommunications, or other pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes ſhould haue been vſed or gone about: eſpecially by ſuch men as father <hi>Parſons</hi> and other Ieſuited hot ſpurres: whoſe profeſſion being farre otherwiſe in labouring for conuerſion of countries, the euill ſucces which he and all his confederates haue had in all their proceedings againſt princes, doth giue all the world to vnderſtand that God was not pleaſed from the beginning with the Ieſuiticall courſes.

And if <hi>Parſons</hi> and his aſſociates had not buſied themſelues with that they ſhould nor, then had we not now medled in this place with that we would not: as whereunto for a iuſt defence of all loyall catholike ſubiects, ignorant of <hi>Parſons</hi> and his complices drifts, we are now conſtrained to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales, apologies and replies. For what good ſoeuer the firſt or againe renewing of the excommunication, the printing &amp; reprinting of ſtate bookes and other practiſes may bring hereafter to the Church of God: we neither ſee it, neither knowe it. But ſure we are that for the preſent, nothing hath done vs greater harme, nor giuen our common enimies greater aduantages againſt vs. It is elſewhere ſet downe how that her Maieſtie vſed vs kindly for the ſpace of the firſt ten yeers of her highnes raigne, the ſtate of the catholikes in England that while was tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and after a ſort in ſome good quiet.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:20192:140"/> from a Lady of the Court: how great quiet the ſtate and Court was in, for twelue yeeres ſpace: no talke of treaſons nor conſpiracies, no iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies nor ſuſpitions, no enuie nor ſupplantations, no feare of murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings nor maſſacrings, no queſtion of conſcience nor religion, all liued in quiet content, and right good fellowſhip was amongſt them, both Lords and Ladies, wiues and maidens, nobles and gentles, knights and eſquires, married and ſingle, of all degrees: a ioy it was to haue been in the Court in thoſe daies (ſaith <hi>Parſons</hi> in that Ladies name, whoſe words mooued much the company where ſhe was (as women ſaith he, are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in moouing where and when they pleaſe) ſhe did deliuer her mind with ſo ſweete a countenance and courtly a grace &amp;c.) Now whiles you were (ſay our aduerſaries) thus kindly vſed of her highnes, how treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly was ſhe dealt withall by you? For what had you to doe being catholikes and religious prieſts, as Ieſuits terme themſelues, with ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pamphlets, libels, and other fooleries abroad of any miſdemeanor in her Maieſties ſubiects and peeres of the realme?

And for you it was to haue handled grauer, higher and more important matters: and that concerning ſoule points, not ſubtilties nor new deuiſes; much leſſe to haue dealt againſt her Maieſtie and the ſtate in ſo traiterous a manner, as in a late treatiſe ſet out by our brethren, doth at large appeere. Where to our vnſpeakable greefe the world ſhall ſee, that we our ſelues, who would be termed catholikes, and that of all ſorts, haue beene the true cauſes of all our owne calamities. When I was examined before ſome of the high Commiſſioners at the Gildhall about 14. yeeres agone, concerning matters of ſtate, and eſpecially about the ſix Interrogatories (which we commonly called the ſix bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die articles:) knowing my ſelfe innocent from the beginning of any the leaſt diſloyall thought: I haue often ſince much muſed with my ſelfe, what ſhould haue mooued her Maieſties honorable Councell to haue propoſed theſe articles to prieſts: but moſt of all why ſuch ſtraite lawes were made for comming into England of Seminarie prieſts, bringing in of <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> croſſes, medals, graines &amp;c. reconcilement perſwaſions to the catholike faith, and the like: All which when I ſaw the bookes of the excommunication of her Maieſtie by <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> &amp; diuers others tending to that purpoſe written ſince, and withall had well conſidered what the Ieſuits dealing had beene: how that they had procured theſe indulgences &amp; pardons to ſerue their owne turne therewith: I then wel perceiued vpon what grounds the ſaid ſix articles were built. And Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bales</hi> a bleſſed martyr ſhall witnes with me at the latter day, how woe my hart was, vpon the laſt ſpeech he and I had together (in the houſe of an honorable perſon where we met) about thoſe and other

And therefore of all other orders of religion (were I to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any) I would neuer be Ieſuit whiles I liued. And this may ſuffice for the matter in queſtion to conuince any catholikes true meaning hart, that the circumſtances well conſidered (with all humble obedience to the See apoſtolike be it ſpoken) there neither was due circumſtances in the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> to binde any to withdrawe their allegiance from our Soueraigne, neither (and much leſſe) was it conuenient, that the ſame excommunication ſhould haue beene renewed againe.</p>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:20192:143"/> or father <hi>Southwels</hi> Epiſtle to her Maieſtie are written: alwaies in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or reproouing ſome one, or many, or all her highnes nobles and ciuill magiſtrates: a very indiſcreete part in them how true ſoeuer the reports had beene; our frownd on ſtate conſidered, and that we were to ſeeke the fauor of all, not to exaſperate any eſpecially ſo neere her Maieſtie as thoſe were &amp;c. But amongſt many woorthy examples and reaſons alledged by theſe ancient fathers to the heathen emperors in the primitiue Church, why they ſhould grant libertie of conſcience to Chriſtians: arguments deduced from policie, ciuilitie, humanitie, and their owne princely benignitie (for they not accuſtomed with matters of faith, religion &amp; conſcience being infidels, onely morall, ciuill, politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and humane reſpects, ſuch as ſome ſparks of <hi>Syndereſis,</hi> &amp; the lawes of reaſon, of nature and nations are in man) were motiues to moone them to ſurceaſe from perſecution, or elſe nothing. Of all the reſt <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras</hi> in his Apologie to the emperor <hi>Commodus</hi> on the behalfe of the Chriſtians frameth his ſpeech to the beſt conſtruction and fitlieſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the matter now in queſtion, to the iudgement of many on the Engliſh catholikes behalfe to our Soueraigne. For the ſumme of <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras</hi> ſpeech conſiſting (as it doth) in this: that one and a chiefe reaſon why the emperor ſhould grant free vſe and libertie of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Chriſtians, was for that, his Maieſtie together with all his predeceſſors, freely granted the ſame freedome to all other ſects, ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, profeſſors of religion, and worſhippers of ſundry gods and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, as far different in the worſhip done to, and derogating from the Maieſtie and honor of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as the God of the Chriſtians, or worſhip done vnto him did or could any way differ or derogate. And ſeeing that euery particular prouince, countrie and people had their peculiar gods to themſelues, whom they worſhipped with a kinde of ſingularitie vſed in one thing or other towardes them, that others wanted, where euer they went or liued either in the prouince of their birth, or elſe tranſported to ſome region further of, or nearer hand, and yet neuer once examined nor asked the queſtion why they did ſo: then <hi>ab indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione, Athenagoras</hi> did conclude euen <hi>iure gentium,</hi> that the Chriſtians throughout the emperors dominions, ought to haue the like libertie, tolleration and conniuence granted them. Whereupon our catholikes in England bringing in an argument <hi>à ſimili,</hi> that if there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re reaſon why the Emperor ſhould permit the Chriſtian religion as well as other religions oppoſite to the Romane rites in gentiliſme, that were then allowed of, with all their pluralities: of like ſort then ſay ours; ſeeing her Maieſtie permitteth Puritanes, Browniſts (or Barowiſts) Familians, &amp;c. to liue quiet within her dominions; it were agreeing as well to mercy ſuited alwaies beſt with maieſtie, as alſo to, if not our iuſt, yet our lawfull deſires, for to haue the like libertie, or at leaſt not to bee
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:20192:144"/> haunted with continuall ſearchings, hazard of life, ordinarie taxations and loſſes of lands and goods taken from them, as the catholike recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants are and haue beene long in theſe vexations, troubles and dangers, from whence all other are free. Amidſt this argument they vrge fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for that the emperors in thoſe daies were heathen, our Soueraigne a Chriſtian; theirs often ſtrangers to the Romanes, yea alwaies ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to one nation or other, ouer which they gouerned, eſpecially du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the raignes of ſome thirty emperors, euen vntill <hi>Constantine</hi> the great his time (by reaſon that the emperiall crowne of <hi>Caeſar</hi> went by meere election that while, whereupon followed ſo many bloodie mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, maſſacrings, and open warres againſt one another, for aſpiring to the emperiall ſoueraigntie. Here one proclaimed emperor in the field by a rabble of vnruly ſoldiers; there another denounced, inſtalled and crowned emperor by the Senate, and he ſometimes an Italian, otherwhile a Spaniard, otherwhile a Frenchman, then a Britane borne in this lande, and after that perhaps a Grecian &amp;c:) Whereas now our Lady and Soueraigne, is of our owne nation, birth, blood, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, naturall incline, and all things to mooue to lenitie. Againe their pluralities of gods and diuerſities of worſhips, ſacrifices, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies tended onely to points of religion, ſects and opinions amongſt themſelues, no way otherwiſe derogating to the imperiall crowne of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> But theſe in England (which yet as I ſaid are permiſſible) differ not onely, all of them in generall, from the preſent church of England, yea, and one from another in matters of faith, and points of religion beſides, as much as the catholikes do differ from the Proteſtants, if not more; but euen alſo in matters of ſtate in the higheſt degree: the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans as eagerly ſeeking and wiſhing the death of her Maieſtie, and both writing and ſpeaking as boldly vnto her as any traytor euer did or durſt ſpeake to his prince, and yet they are permitted to liue and enioy their liberty, whereas the catholiks can not be any way endured: which to nations abroad giueth no little cauſe of admiration.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they otherwhiles turnd ouer their bookes, wherein they had regiſtred the imperiall decrees of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and finding amongſt other points of importance belonging to this great cauſe of our heauines and woonder, how that euer ſo ſore an affliction of catholikes ſhould haue fallen out in our infortunate age, and that in our natiue countrey, and amongſt our owne deereſt and neereſt friends, by all coniunctions of lawes, orders &amp; motiues, they had there quoted how that in time of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſme &amp; other afflictions &amp; perſecutions of the church vnder <hi>Iulian,</hi> vnder <hi>Valens,</hi> vnder <hi>Constans,</hi> vnder <hi>Constantius,</hi> vnder <hi>Theodoret</hi> and others the like: when the ſame emperors were fautors, yea and earneſt perſecutuors, protectors and patrons of the catholikes aduerſaries, and that all the Chriſtian world was infected with thoſe hereſies, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:20192:144"/> 400. yeeres ere they were quite extinct: yet were theſe great Monarches and mighties of the world ſo far from inflicting ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall affliction vpon all catholikes in thoſe daies, as now the Engliſh catholikes do ſuſtaine; that they thought it enough to haue them, and that but in ſome places, for to be depriued of their Benefices, Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, and other as well eccleſiaſticall as temporall dignities and offices, ſuffragating <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops and others in their places, without further taxes laide vpon them, or other troubles and vexations in generall. For what was done in ſpeciall againſt Saint <hi>Siluester,</hi> and Saint <hi>Silueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> martyr; againſt Saint <hi>Baſill</hi> and Saint <hi>Martin</hi> martyr; againſt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and Saint <hi>Donatus</hi> both martyrs: againſt Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſostom</hi> and others, it was of priuate grudge and no generall cauſe. Nay, which was more, euen thoſe ſame emperors that perſecuted the catholikes moſt; yet often of their owne princely benignity and meere motion, proceeding of their innate clemencie; they would and did au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe, graunt, and make offer from their imperiall throne to ſundrie catholike Biſhops and other prelats, euen vnder their hands. (For as I ſaid before in places, prouinces and countries further of, though ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Romane empire, there was no queſtion made of hauing catholiks or <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops equally &amp; alike, as the number of the one or other religions did ſway moſt) that they might vſe their Epiſcopal iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions and other rites and ceremonies agreeing to the cuſtome of the catholike church &amp;c. And at Millane, at Antioch, at Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and elſewhere, were ſometimes offers, and often graunts made to catholikes to haue their churches &amp; chappels to themſelues apart from the <hi>Arrians</hi> and other infeſt enimies of the catholikes, ſuffering them (the ſaide clergie on both ſides) to do it by diſpitions amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, neuer perſecuting any catholike for that cauſe, vnleſſe ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grudge or occaſion of high diſpleaſure taken by the emperors againſt ſome particular perſon (which for the moſt part proceeded on the <hi>Arrians</hi> behalfe and ſuggeſtion made by them) had mooued them to the contrary. Which being ſo, and that the princely diſpoſition and royall hart of our Soueraigne is behinde none of the woorthieſt empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that euer ſat enthronized with imperiall crowne, for a flexible, milde free nature, and ſweete incline to mercy, bountie, pittie, grace, pardon, fauour and compaſſion taken of her ſubiects (be as they be may) in different affections of religion aliened from her, together with her magnificencie, liberalitie and maieſtie equalling, (if not before them) either great <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Iulius</hi> the woorthy <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Of which two, although it were ſaid of the former in Greece, and of the latter in Rome: that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Conquerour in vſing liberalitie, and <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in pardoning of iniuries, none euer equald or at leaſt went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: yet was it ſpoken (and ſo it is vnderſtood) of precedent
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:20192:145"/> ages, not of future heroeces: we no way yeelding in our heauieſt thoughts, of hart burning griefes ſuſtained, to heare our noble <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> prince peregall, paramount and paragon, the ſo admired at <hi>Saba</hi> of Europes England, as all the world hath woondred, at her more then ordinary indowments of princely nature: otherwiſe accounted of, then as a <hi>Sance-pere:</hi> giuing place to none of former preſent or future times, perſons or ages, for and in all points attending at the gates of royall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or throne of regall Maieſtie. That then notwithſtanding all this: her Highneſſe worne out ſubiects, ſuppliants, poore afflicted catholiks in her priſons, in durance, dangers, and diſtreſſe euery where, ſhould haue ſo hard a happe, as not onely to be depriued of all eccleſiaſticall and temporall dignities, offices, preferments any manner of way, which yet were more tollerable, as a thing they nothing leſſe expect, wiſh for, or deſire; it being ſo, that both clergie and laitie of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes take it as a ſweete chaſticement and fatherly ſcourge ſent them from God, to be humbled with ſo heauie a downefall; but alſo (which doth grieue them moſt) to liue in ſorrow, heauines, and ſuſpition had of their vnattainted loyalties in generall, for ſome priuate offences in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall: that they of al other ſhould feele the force of theſe vnaccuſtomed frownes: which pearce thoſe harts the deepeſt, whoſe faithfull ſeruices haue beene deereſt to their Soueraignes, in their owne and their forefathers daies: That not one noble will ſpeake for them: that no ſolace ſhould be left them: no comfort euer affoorded them: no hope at all this long time giuen them, of euer receiuing a glympſe or glance of thoſe accuſtomed gracious ſmyles, which ordinarily do flowe in pearld ſtreames, from lions hart, of trueſt golde guſhing out at ſiluer lymbecks, of egles eies all royall in their rarenes: That this ſhould be all catholikes heauie caſe: her highnes a prince, and ſecond to none in maieſtie, mercy, and magnificencie: her catholike ſubiects ſeconded with as fewe for ſeruice, ſubmiſſion and loyaltie: and yet that they ſhould be put from time to time to ſuch ſore trials, and indure ſo many calamities, is a ſutable cauſe with the reſt of admiration and woonder.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, they ſometimes caſt their eies aſide to Turkes, to Perſians, to all Pagan prouinces, to ſee if they can eſpie any one ſect, profeſſion, or profeſſors of religion, toſſed, turmoilde, and tormented as the Engliſh are, and throughout all this vaſte <hi>Macrocoſme,</hi> they finde not one patterne, ſampler, nor example left to poſteritie to bee recorded like to ours. The Sophy indeede hath a long time had great and mortall wars with the <hi>Ottomane</hi> race, family, and ſucceſſors in the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh tribe; ſo hath great <hi>Mogor,</hi> great <hi>Cam</hi> of Catay, <hi>Presbyter Iohn,</hi> and other monarches adioyning and affronting him: but yet omitting the generall contention amongſt the Mahumetans about the heires of <hi>Ella,</hi> and the body of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> there is a libertie graunted for religion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:20192:145"/> to all men, in a ſort more tollerable then in England is to be heard of for catholiks to enioy. The very Turke (who hath the ſtraiteſt lawes) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth indeed all talke, diſputation, or controuerſie to be about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but yet he permitteth either Chriſtians or any other to liue quiet vnder him, vſing their owne rites, ſeruice, and ceremonies, for paying a certaine yeerely tribute: which is not much more then catholikes pay in England, euen to their naturall Prince and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and yet cannot haue the like ſecuritie, ſafetie, and quiet, from inferior officers: but ſtill in one place or other within her Maieſties do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions they are pild and pold to the vttermoſt: So as when all is quiet at London, then are they aloft in Yorkſhire, and throughout the North: when quiet there, then vp in Wales, and the marches that way. And thus perſecution running <hi>per circulum,</hi> the lande neuer wholly at reſt and quiet: theſe things manie learned men and others haue woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, not knowing what were the cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, ſometimes thoſe graue and reuerend prelats caſt backe their eies to theſe our latter ages and preſent times wherein now we liue, and to the bordering kingdomes and princes round about vs, to ſee whether any like to theſe our Engliſh miſeries and catholike diſtreſſes can be found. And in Germany howſoeuer there be ſome ſlacknes and diſlikes at their Diets and election of their <hi>Caeſar:</hi> yet in ciuil conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one with another, and for life, gouernment and order, the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour though a catholike findeth as great ſeruice and concord amongſt his ſubiects, and they againe vſe and enioy all their immunities, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and liberties with as great content and quiet liuing in one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, in one citie, in one towne, in one ſtreete, yea and in one houſe ſometimes together of diffrent, as if they were all of one minde, faith, and religion. In Fraunce we ſee what libertie of conſcience wrought. Did it not as well animate the Hugonites to ioyne with king <hi>Henry</hi> of the houſe of Valois then a catholike in ſhewe, howſoeuer the Ieſuits cenſure of his hart, as it did of like ſort the catholikes to ioyne with the now moſt Chriſtian and catholike king <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. then a Proteſtant? yea, &amp; did they not ſticke as ſure &amp; faſt to his chriſtian Maieſtie, as if he had been of their owne catholike religion &amp; profeſſion, &amp; that with as great alacritie of minde, in regard of his preſent right to that crowne, and their future hopes of his conuerſion to their church and faith, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it hapned God ſweetly ſo diſpoſing: that he who could not by rough handling be made flexible by experience of his ſubiects loyaltie, is of a lyon becom a lambe. In few, we ſee in Polony, in Sweden, in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in Flaunders and euery where, that catholikes are together with thoſe of other profeſſions, ſects, and opinions, vnleſſe it be where onely the Conſiſtorian <hi>Caluinian, Cartwrightian</hi> puritans rule the roſt, and that a company of miniſters, or exorbitant ſuperintendants ouertop both
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:20192:146"/> Prince, prelate, and all, as in Scotland and at Geneua, &amp;c. Otherwiſe all kings and princes of this age haue iudged it in pollicie the fitteſt, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, ſafeſt, and moſt honorable and princely courſe they could haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: to graunt libertie of conſcience to their ſubiects. Which ſeeing our ſoueraigne Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hath not granted, and yet is knowne to be in her owne high towring princely wiſedome of as high a pitch, ſound and deepe conceite, cenſure, and iudgement: in reach not to be ſeconded of any of theſe: adding heereunto, that for gouernment of her land, for policie in her ſtate, for noblenes in her court, her Highnes hath the choice of as fine, delicate and daintie breed of gallant, graue, quicke wits as Europe, nay as Afrike, nay as Aſia, nay as the world this day enioyes. The Italian, the Spaniard, the Polonian, the Sweden, the Moſcouite, the Turke, the Perſian, and who not is willing to aduaunce her Maieſties meaneſt ſort of ſubiects, ſometime to the higheſt types of honor, to winne them wholy to be theirs, to learne witte, ſleight, and pollicie out of their practiſe and experience. Theſe Boreas blaſted lads, borne vnder the Britaine Ocean, able to fire with their wits the hotte climatical Southerne Sages: witnes our <hi>Stukeleyes,</hi> our <hi>Candiſhes,</hi> our <hi>Furbiſhers,</hi> our <hi>Drakes,</hi> our <hi>Hilles,</hi> our <hi>Sherleys,</hi> our <hi>Parſons, &amp;c.</hi> All theſe circumſtances duly weighed: that this heauie yoke ſhould be laide by ſo mercifull, wiſe, and prudent a prince, vpon the weake neckes of her poore ſubiects with weight importable for them to carry, vnleſſe her highnes ſhould ſtretch foorth her accuſtomed Atlantike armes of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, to ſupport them before they ſinke downe right vnder their burthen. That this ſeueritie ſhould be more vſed againſt catholiks in England, then either any catholike king or prince of other profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either Chriſtian or heathen vſe againſt either ſubiects or forrainers of contrary religions vnto the ſaid princes throughout the worlde this day: This is the point which many ſtande vpon in admiring how euer things ſhould haue come to that paſſe they are at in England concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the affliction of catholikes, and cannot finde out the cauſes.</p>
                  <p>This then to make manifeſt to all the world by an hiſtoricall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and that howſoeuer we haue matter enough againſt our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries euen for religions ſake, yet neither to aggrauate more then is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, nor to accuſe further then is expedient: nor to excuſe more then is conuenient: nor yet to lay the fault of any that is faultleſſe: therefore ſhall it be made knowne, that as the affliction of catholiks in England hath beene in very deed extraordinary as is heere ſet downe, and many an innocent man loſt his life: ſo alſo hath the cauſe thereof beene extraordinary; and ſo farre beyond the accuſtomed occaſions of perſecution giuen to any prince in chriſtendome, or monarchie, that is, or euer was in the world to this hower (vnleſſe the Puritanes of Scotland, which may in ſome ſort equall the offence heere to be ſet
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:20192:146"/> downe) as rather it is to be woondred at (all things duly conſidered) that any one catholike is left on liue in England, then that our perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath beene ſo great: for name one nation (I know none can) vnder heauen, where the ſubiects (eſpecially if they were catholikes) euer ſought the death of their Soueraigne (though of a different religion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them) the conqueſt of their natiue land, the ſubuerſion of the ſtate, the depopulation of the weale publike, the alteration &amp; change of al lawes, cuſtoms, &amp; orders, &amp; in few the vtter deuaſtation, deſolation, &amp; deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of al the ancient inhabitants of their land, in ſo vnnatural, vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, vncatholike a maner, as the Spaniſh faction haue ſought it in our owne fleſh and bloud againſt this realme: which treacherous courſes, although they were but ſome fewe and thoſe priuate perſons offences: and by conſequent in a court of conſcience, and in rigour of iuſtice, the reſt neither acting, nor concurring, nor conſenting to their conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; were innocent and no way to be vſed with that ſeueritie as many catholiks haue beene. Yet foraſmuch as the pretences of ſuch practiſes were generall and common to all catholikes alike: all maintaining one and the ſame opinion concerning what might be done by apoſtolicall power and authoritie, and neuer talking of what was neceſſarie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it that her Maieſtie and the ſtate ſtanding on the other ſide af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in religion as they did: had both cauſe to iudge <hi>ſecundum allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta &amp; probata in foro externo,</hi> and alſo can not otherwiſe be thought of, but that the circumſtances on all ſides conſidered, as well making for her owne ſecuritie, as alſo for a <hi>Non</hi>-knowledge, what catholiks were guiltie, and who were free; her Maieſties lawes and proceedings againſt catholikes haue beene both milde and mercifull. And as we are to thinke (in deed) our happe now to be hard if no mitigation nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſoe ſhould be made for the innocent (now that the way and meanes is knowne for diſcouery of traytors, &amp; diſtinguiſhing betwixt ſtate catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks &amp; catholike loyall ſubiects: ſo alſo are we to giue her Highnes hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thanks for our liues, that we were not al cut off, whiles no difference was made, put, nor knowne betwixt the ſecular prieſts &amp; Ieſuits: &amp; that we haue been permitted to liue to this happy houre, of manifeſting our catholike co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy &amp; obedience to the See apoſtolike in al our actions, and our naturall loyaltie and ſeruiceable harts to our Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in all our proceedings, in neither ſtayning our catholike religion with vnnaturall treaſon, nor prieſtly function with factious diſpoſitions and ſtate affaires.

The third, for that all ſchoole Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being baniſhed out of the Seminary at Doway (bicauſe ſaith <hi>Parſons Scientia inflat</hi>) his ſubiect Doctor <hi>Woorthington</hi> muſt teach them to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what he will haue them in England els get they no faculties. Which things occaſionating a meruailous great ſuſpition to be had of all catholikes by the ſtate, and thereby withall increaſing our manifold dangers on euery ſide: it makes the caſe very doubtfull what to thinke of continuance of the Seminaries being all now vnder theſe blody cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell harted traiterous and moſt vnnatural, irreligious and conſcienceleſſe
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:20192:147"/> Ieſuites tirannicall gouernment. Therefore to the article thus I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that I am not of their opinion who hold that the ſaid Engliſh Seminaries at Rome and Rhemes were ordained of purpoſe to traine vp ſeditious youths (as our aduerſaries ſay) and after ſome time to ſend them into England to moue rebellion. Secondly, I am fully perſwaded that his holineſſe Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth and ſome others had very ſincere harts in the erecting of them, and were far from any intent to haue the Seminary prieſts of England brought vp there in any treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or traiterous manner, but in a moſt holy, religious and vertuous courſe of life, ſtudy, and exerciſe: as Cardinall <hi>Allane</hi> in his apollogie doth demonſtrate. Thirdly, no man ſhall be able to write that commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their doings therein, whereunto I will not moſt willingly ſubſcribe, and auowe whiles breth is in my body, or life doth laſt in me. Yet all this notwithſtanding as the caſe is now with the ſaid Seminaries, I am of opinion (ſetting aſide the ſaid holy intent and godly inſtitution) that no catholikes ought to ſend their children or friends thither. Firſt, bicauſe they are greatly degenerated (though the time be not long ſince they were erected) from their primitiue foundation and intent of the founders. Secondly, they were ordained for the training vp of the beſt wits to be ſecular prieſts: but now they are abuſed to the increaſing of the number of the Ieſuites. Thirdly, true caſes of conſcience, ſchoole diuinity, poſitiue exerciſes for matters of controuerſie in religion, and other ſtudies of humanitie beſides were there taught: but now their heads muſt be filled with treacheries, equiuocations, diſſimulation, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and all kind of falſhood: otherwiſe they are not fit diſciples of Ieſuiticall traitors nor fit for to be of the Spaniards faction. Fourthly, the Ieſuites haue gotten into their hands the gouernment of the ſame Seminaries: who being very odious men to diuers ſtates will bring like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a deteſtation of all ſuch prieſts as ſhalbe brought vp vnderneath them. Fiftly, we find by experience that the Ieſuites here in England doe therefore chalenge ſuperioritie and precedency of the ſecular prieſts, bicauſe whileſt they were in the Seminaries they were brought vp and trained by them: which tendeth to the great derogation of the ſecular prieſthood. Sixtly, although her Maieſty and the ſtate hitherto haue not dealt ſo roughly either with prieſts or other catholikes as they might haue done: yet knowing now that our engliſh ſtudents being brought vp by Parſons direction chiefly, and that in their miſſions hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his manner is to bind them to ſet out the ſaid <hi>Infantaes</hi> title as is before expreſſed: it cannot chuſe but that the ſtate will proceede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them as they ſhalbe taken with greater ſeueritie. Seuenthly, whereas heretofore it was made onely ſubiect to a pecuniary mulet for any catholike to ſend their ſons or friends beyond the ſeas: if hereafter
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:20192:148"/> a lawe be made to inflict the ſame puniſhment vpon ſuch as ſende youths thither: who can iuſtly take exception to it? And the rather can they not take exception to ſuch a law: bicauſe of the puniſhment that is already ordained for thoſe that ſhall receiue prieſts from thence. Now for the laſt point in the article: my opinion is and I verily thinke that all catholike Engliſh ſubiects, prieſts or lay perſons (that are not to too much bewitched with Ieſuitiſme) are of my mind: that all faithful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes (the premiſſes conſidered) are bound in conſcience to become moſt humble ſutors to his holines for the remoouing of all Ieſuits not onely out of England (where they haue already wrought all our woes) but euen alſo from intermedling in any ſort with the ſaid Seminaries in any place beyond the ſeas. Or if they cannot be heard through the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiuilian practiſes of the Ieſuits (as queſtionles what the malice of the diuell, or wit of his fowle inſtrument <hi>Parſons</hi> can inuent ſhalbe vrged to the vttermoſt to ſtop this courſe): then they are to fall to their praiers that God himſelfe will thruſt out laborers into this vineyard: and draw the harts of the ſtudents in our owne vniuerſities here in England: to receiue and embrace the catholike faith, if not in generall (which we hartily wiſh and pray for) yet in ſome certaine colledges either in the one or the other: And withall for the better hope thereof to commence our humble ſute vnto her Maieſtie, ioyning thereunto our hartie pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that God of his mercy would vouchſafe to incline her princely hart to grant vs ſome colledge or other houſe fit for that purpoſe, with free leaue to teach and reade ſuch lectures as may be fitting for our profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for to withdraw and take away all occaſions or neceſſities of ſending any of our friends beyond the ſeas. In which moſt pious, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike and honorable acte (fitly agreeing to her Maieſtie, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and graunted euen of heathen princes to chriſtian prieſts and prelats) her Highnes ſhould not onely merite laſting fame, renowne; and memorie to all poſteritie, but euen alſo thereby cut off occaſions of infection with Ieſuiticall conſpiracies euer heereafter: when as ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious rotten weedes ſhould be rooted out, which both indanger her royall perſon and preſent ſtate, and bring vs all her faithfull ſubiects to be ſuſpected by their meanes. And as for ſtudy, learning, and other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike exerciſes, let this good motiue (deere catholikes) be no waie heauily taken, nor raſhly cenſured: as though there were no learning nor method of teaching, nor any gouernment or vertuous exerciſe, but where a Ieſuite beares the ſtroke. For know you this, that as there are their betters in England and out of it that are no Ieſuits, euen of our owne nation this day in all things required in teachers, maſters, and gouernors: ſo before euer any Ieſuits came or were in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> the Vniuerſities of Oxford and Cambridge floriſhed amongſt the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſchooles in Chriſtendome: either for ſchoole method or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:20192:148"/> doctrine in Diuinitie, Philoſophie, or any other ſtudie. And ſeeing it cannot be denied but that for all the Ieſuits boaſt of their learning, gouernment, method of teaching, and I can not tell what: yet ſtill haue the ſeculars &amp; Seminarie prieſts beene the chiefe Readers &amp; profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Clarks either in Diuinitie or philoſophy, that haue gone out of our Nation in theſe daies: witneſſe our <hi>Allans,</hi> our <hi>Stapletons,</hi> our <hi>Giffords,</hi> our <hi>Hardings,</hi> our <hi>Parkinſons,</hi> our <hi>Elyes,</hi> our <hi>Kellingſons,</hi> with ſundrie other Doctors &amp; ſchoolemen (to omit, thoſe that are in England at this preſent, togither with diuers religious Engliſhmen of S. <hi>Benedicts,</hi> of S. <hi>Dominicks,</hi> of S. <hi>Fraunces,</hi> and of other religious orders:) al of them to be preferred before our new illuminates theſe vainglorious vanting men. Beſides we ſee that for al our Seminaries vnder the Ieſuits, yet the moſt famous men from time to time haue beene brought vp vnder the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar clergie, or the <hi>Dominican</hi> preachrers and teachers in all nations. Alſo it is well knowne, that there is nothing wanting in our Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties heere in England for making profound clarks and learned men in deede: ſaue onely that ſound catholike doctrine and ſchoole method which was vſed in <hi>Gabrell Beoll,</hi> in <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales,</hi> and in <hi>Iohn Scots</hi> daies. For otherwiſe neuer was there a finer breed of wits, nor brauer Orators, nor more pleaſant Poets, nor perfecter Grammarians, nor more copious Linguiſts, nor riper men in all ſtudies of humanitie, then are brought vp in our Engliſh Vniuerſities. Therefore ſeeing that which is wanting might be ſupplied by catholike doctors and teachers of our owne nation (any Ieſuits equals) and that we ſee ſundrie of the fineſt wits reſort to our ſide daily, notwithſtanding all theſe either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions betwixt vs and the Ieſuits, or yet the preſent affliction and danger we all do liue in of our common aduerſaries: then thinke (deere catholiks) as true it is, that there can no queſtion be made of it to the contrary, but that where one commeth now vnto vs, there would then come ten of all ſorts, by ſuch carefull diligence and choiſe of tutors as vpon this ſo gracious a grant (O happie who may liue to ſee it) of her Maieſtie, might be vſed both in Oxford and Cambridge; as that you might haue your children there inclined and trained vp with ſome ſuch good conceits of the catholike faith and religion, as nouriſhed and cheriſhed therein by you that are their friends in natural loue and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and confirmed by vs that are prieſts, as in chriſtian charity and catholike dutie we are bound: there would quickly follow a ioyfull for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes of the Ieſuits exile, as the perturbers of both the catholike church and Englands common-wealth, and ruine of vs all if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine amongſt vs.</p>
                  <p>And thus hauing brought this long, tedious, intricate, and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, difficult, and doubtfull <hi>Quodlibet</hi> of plots, by ſtatizing to an end in ſome ſort, though not halfe ſo much ſaid heerein, as both the waight
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:20192:149"/> of the matter it ſelfe doth require, and alſo as willing I was and am to haue written thereof, as well in reſpect of iuſtice as of charity (both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me to ſpeake:) were I not infringed vpon other conſiderations iuſtly compelling me to ſilence. Therefore vnwilling to holde you any longer in this ſo diſcomfortable a party, as neceſſarily the talke of theſe matters muſt needs be to many deuout ſoules, which no doubt will be aſſaulted with variable cogitations in the peruſe of this diſcourſe, wo be to them who haue occaſioned ſuch ſtraite paſſages of our heauines: I now end in harty praier vpon my knees, that God may turne all to his glory, as well for religion as ſtate: and ſo proceed to other matters in hand.</p>

            <p>HAuing ſaid more in the laſt <hi>Quodlibet</hi> then I ſhall haue thanks for at the Ieſuits hands, but that I am <hi>Iohn Indifferent</hi> and a <hi>Wilfull Will,</hi> that wil neuer force a friend nor feare a foe in an act of publike iuſtice: as I hold it for ſuch that a greater act both of iuſtice &amp; of chatity could not be, then (if my poore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits by pen expreſſed can do it) to defend Gods cauſe &amp; quarrell, my prince &amp; countries right, the gauleleſſe catholikes innocent harts: and to firret theſe cony-catching Ieſuits out of conceit from all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh berries or warrens, that carrie either oile of perfect charitie in their lampes, or fire of true catholike zeale within their breaſtes, or naturall affection to their prince, their countrie, their parents, children, fleſh and blood, their deereſt friends. Hereupon there doth occurre to my memorie two generall <hi>Quodlibets</hi> which make as much for our purpoſe as any we haue hitherto handled, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to make knowne to the world the ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forme, (but in deede very weake) foundation the Ieſuits haue laied, eſpecially this moſt Atheall Polypragmon father <hi>Parſons</hi>) to perfect the platforme of ſtatizing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the laſt <hi>Quodlibet</hi> precedent, for the ouerthrowe of all that are not as they.

               <p>WHether is the practiſe of the Ieſuits agreeable to chriſtian charitie, and the dutie of true ſubiects, to interprete euery thing that their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne and the ſtate of the countrey doth, in the woorſt part, to ſlaunder, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue, and calumniate the king their Lord, and his proceedings, by libels and ſundry ſorts of chartals, bookes, and pamphlets; of purpoſe both to make his highnes, his gouernment, and his whole kingdome, as much as in them lieth offenſiue to other princes now, and odious heereafter to all poſteritie or not?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>THE ANSWERE.</head>
                  <p>THe Quodlibets of ſtate and ſucceſſion hauing ſuch an affinity by ſequell of proper kind (as we now handle them) that the one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the other as the ſhadow doth the body: there is nothing ſaid in the laſt generall Quodlibet of ſtate, but it hath a relation to this of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. So as it can not be otherwiſe imagined, but that the Ieſuites haue a further drift and intend a greater miſchiefe, then all the world dreames of: to make princes, ſtate, gouernment, and all authoritie, ſeeme odious to the multitude. Therefore I affirme and ſay abſolutely as in my hart I thinke it: that their proceedings therein, are neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, catholike, chriſtian, nor dutifull, but very barbarous, impious, and diſhoneſt: which I prooue firſt by teſtimony of holy writ: <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeake euill of the prince of thy people,</hi> ſaid the wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his many Prouerbes. Secondly, <hi>Curſe not the king: no not in thy thought,</hi> ſaid the great Preacher in his eccleſiaſticks: and to the ſame purpoſe are the two great princes of the earth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> his words in his firſt Epiſtle, and Saint <hi>Paule</hi> his ſpeech by an Epiſtle to <hi>Titus.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againe if any action can beare two conſtructions: charity bindeth a man to take the beſt. But princes haue neuer had more cauſe then now they haue by the Ieſuites practiſes, to be iealous of their eſtates, <hi>ergo</hi> it ought to be conſtrued in the beſt ſenſe, a man may, if their gouernment be contrary to our likings. Fourthly, beſides kings proceedings are oft aboue the capacity of the ſubiects and are not by them to be ſcanned or ſifted: much leſſe to be ſlaundered and depraued. Fiftly, furthermore kings being the fathers of their country if they ſhould haue in their
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:20192:150"/> proceedings any nakednes: their ſubiects ſhew themſelues to be of the generation of <hi>Cham,</hi> that will not rather couer then detect them. But ſuch are the Ieſuits vnnatural harts and greedie deſire of ſoueraignty, as it ſeemeth nothing doth more delight them then to find in a prince, or prieſts coate ſome thing to make them ſeeme odious to their ſubiects or ghoſtly children. Sixtly alſo the honour of our countrie ought to be more deere vnto vs, then our owne credites or eſtimation: nay often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times then our liues themſelues: <hi>ergo,</hi> how can it be choſen but that the Ieſuites being ſo ambitious in ſeeking their owne glory, ſo greedy of their owne praiſes and ſo deeply affecting ſoueraigne dominion, ſhould not condemne themſelues in their owne conſciences in detracting and calumniating their ſoueraignes.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore moſt manifeſt and true as I haue often ſaid and muſt haue often cauſe to repeate the ſame: that of long time the graueſt ſort of the ſecular prieſts in England haue vtterly diſliked ſuch pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and railing treatiſes and bookes as haue bene ſet out to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of her Maieſty and ſtate here. The booke that Doctor <hi>Saunders</hi> writ <hi>De ſchiſmate,</hi> and his other <hi>De viſibili Monarchia,</hi> we wiſh with all our harts that they had neuer ſeen light. Diuers of father <hi>Parſons</hi> books letters, and treatiſes, we haue and do from our very harts vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them: as conteining many ſeditious and trayterous points: and being very full of ſlaunderous ſpeeches and impudent calumniations. <hi>Andreas Philopater</hi> being the fruits of father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and father <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> we hold to be fraught till it almoſt burſt againe (as ſome of my brethren elſewhere haue noted) with all Ieſuiticall pride and poyſon. And as touching the Exhortation before mentioned printed 1588. it is ſo deteſtable a treatiſe, as all poſterity cannot chooſe but condemne father <hi>Parſons</hi> for a moſt ſcurrilous traytor. If he had beene brought vp amongſt all the ruffians and Curtizans in Chriſtendome, he could not haue learned to haue writ more vilely, prophanely, and heathniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Furthermore, in that father <hi>Parſons</hi> and his fellow father <hi>Creſwell,</hi> do glory in their ſaid booke that they haue cauſed not onely it, but alſo maſter <hi>Saunders</hi> treatiſe <hi>De ſchiſmate,</hi> to be tranſlated into the Spaniſh toong, and do reioyce, that thereby the Spaniards are brought already into a greater deteſtation of her Maieſtie, her gouernment &amp; procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings then they had before: I thinke they glory in their owne ſhame, and that they are to be accounted by all true catholikes to be moſt vile and trayterous perſons: that they diſhonor prieſthood, and are as right Ieſuits, as inſolencie and hatred can make them. And ſo I conclude that the Ieſuits practiſes and intents in wreſting their Soueraignes and the ſtate affaires in euery politicall, morall, and humane action, to the worſt ſenſe: is neither agreeing to Chriſtian iuſtice, catholike charitie, nor bounden dutie of true ſubiects: but like rebellious traytors to bring all

                  <p>I Hold it as I ſaid before altogether vnlawfull for them to deale ſo in ſtate matters and by conſequent indecent. Firſt, for that it is againſt the rules of their orders: and very preſumptuous, for any of them to medle with the ſucceſſion to the crowne at all. Secondly, it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne from the very nature of all religious profeſſion, which is a ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of men from the actions of the world. Thirdly, it tendeth to that which we moſt condemne in our common aduerſaries. For the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will be hardly denied: it is lawfull for cleargy men to mannage ciuill cauſes; <hi>ergo</hi> it is lawfull for temporall men to manage cauſes ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall. For wreſt it and wring it aſwell and which way ſoeuer we can poſſibly deuiſe, yet will it alwaies be iudged of our aduerſaries an aſſertion, moſt euident and abſurd to be denied, that temporall men ſhould not haue as great authoritie in church cauſes as Ieſuits, monks, or friers at leaſt, if not alſo as other ſecular and eccleſiaſticall perſons ſhould haue in cauſes ciuill. Fourthly, I ſhall not much need to trauell in this point, bicauſe the Ieſuits themſelues do digeſt nothing woorſe then to heare themſelues charged with it: for it is a practiſe with them to do all things vnder hande, and to be as little ſeene in them as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie they can deuiſe. And therefore (as I haue often told you no leſſe) for the moſt part that which they go about, they do it by other men or by feined names: that if any inconuenience ſhould happen, they might either lay the blame vpon others, or elſe deny it: ſo you ſhal ſee in time that although our worſhipfull Archprieſt hath done nothing but by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haer <hi>Garnets</hi> direction: yet when his ridiculous, vniuſt, vncharitable, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:20192:151"/> will doe the beſt he can to pull his necke out of the coller, and maſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> ſhall be the Aſſe that muſt beare all the burden: So father <hi>Parſons</hi> that holy man by his practiſe doth giue father <hi>Garnet</hi> a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant example. In the moſt of thoſe ſeditious bookes which he the ſaid father <hi>Parſons</hi> hath publiſhed, he hath either concealed his name, or giuen them ſuch names as it hath pleaſed him to deuiſe. And one of his ſaid bookes being ſet out by him vnder the name of maſter <hi>Dolman,</hi> now that many exceptions are taken vnto it: he (good man) was not the author of it: his name is not <hi>Dolman:</hi> and gladly he would ſhift and waſh his hands of it: but all the water betwixt this and Rome will not ſerue his turne ſo to do: although by the common principle of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, he may by lying and equiuocating make a faire ſhew. But of this enough is ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the ſecond point I will now make it plaine vnto you: that the Ieſuits being charged as in the former queſtion is ſet downe, are not therein ſlaundered any way vniuſtly. For, Firſt, it is plaine that father <hi>Parſons</hi> and his company (diuide it amongſt them how they liſt) haue laide a plot as being moſt conſonant and fitting to their other deſignments, that the common lawes of the Realme of England muſt be (forſooth) either aboliſhed vtterly, or elſe beare no greater ſway in the Realme then now the ciuill lawe doth. And the chiefe reaſon is, for that the ſtate of the crowne and kingdome by the common lawes is ſo ſtrongly ſetled, as whileſt they continue, the Ieſuits ſee not how they can worke their wils. And on the other ſide, in the ciuill lawes they thinke they haue ſome ſhreds, whereby they may patch a cloake toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to couer a bloodly ſhew of their treaſons for the preſent, from the eies of the vulgar ſort. And certainly I could not chooſe but ſmile when I read this point in father <hi>Parſons</hi> booke, to ſee how prettily this fine fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred figgeboy conueigheth his matter: how the common lawyers muſt waite vpon the Ciuilians to beare their bookes after them: and how they are to applaud to all that the doctors will auerre to be lawe vpon their bare words vnto them. Secondly, the ſaid good father deeming of all men (it ſeemeth) by himſelfe, hath ſet downe a courſe how euery man may ſhake off all authoritie at their pleaſures, as if he woulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a newe Anabaptiſt, or king <hi>Iohn</hi> of Leyden, to draw all the world into a mutinie, rebellion, or combuſtion. And this ſtratageme is how the common people may be inueigled and ſeduced to conceit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſuch a libertie and prerogatiue, as that it may be lawfull for them when they thinke meete, to place and diſplace kings and princes, as men may doe their tenants at will, hirelings, or ordinarie ſeruants. Which Anabaptiſticall and abhominable doctrine, proceeding from a turbulent tribe of traiterous Puritanes &amp; other heretikes: this treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ieſuite would now foiſt into the catholike church, as a ground of his
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:20192:151"/> corrupt diuinitie. And ſure it is ſtrange to conſider how the caitiffe handleth this point, giuing aduantage thereby to all nations to reuolt from the See apoſtolike: if any catholike prince would take holde or build vpon this abſurd fellowes word or authoritie. For that amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments he inſiſteth vpon certaine rebellious &amp; moſt traiterous examples, how ſome kings in this Iſland haue beene dealt with. As if a man ſhould take vpon him to prooue murther lawfull, bicauſe many examples of murther may be produced: or as if this were a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: England, Scotland, Ireland, Denmarke, Swethia, many ſtates in Germany, &amp; many men in France and elſe where, haue reiected the authoritie of the Pope his holines, &amp; the See of Rome: therefore Italy, France, Spaine &amp; other catholike countries may do the like. Fourthly, the ſaid good fathers with their ringleader, and muſter-maſter father <hi>Parſons,</hi> do take vpon them in the ſaide booke and in other treatiſes to deale with matters of ſucceſſion and titles of the crowne: as if their bare words were of higher authoritie then either Court Parliamentall, Prince, or Pope: and bicauſe as it ſeemeth their ſaid ringleader is a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard himſelfe, it is woonderfull to ſee what very ſmall account he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſucceſſion by inheritance, title of deſcent, birthright or bloud. Now tell me in this caſe. A gentleman, or ſubſtantiall yeoman hauing one heire and many ſeruants, dieth: were he not an aſſe that would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the right of the ſaide heire ſhould depend vpon the pleaſure of his fathers ſeruants: If they thought meet, he ſhould haue his fathers lands: or otherwiſe, they would beſtow them as they thought good. I am ſure you would account it vniuſt, vnnaturall, indecent, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. And all that this traitorous Ieſuite writeth of this point, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the like folly: whileſt he laboureth ſo giantlike in oppoſing himſelfe againſt ſucceſſion by inheritance to fight moſt impudently with all lawes, nay with nature and with God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto it alſo appertaineth how after he hath contriued the meanes as he thinketh, how to depriue kings and heires from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: he then taketh vpon him, to appoint how others may and are to ſucceede in their roomes, and poſſeſſe their ancient right. And he proceedeth herein as grauely and ſubſtantially, as he hath done in the premiſſes. For except this may carrie a ſhew of a good argument fiue hundred or a thouſand yeeres ſince, the anceſtors of the king of Spaine, the king of Fraunce, and of diuers other kings, had no intereſt to the kingdomes, which now they enioy: therefore ſome others muſt be found out to be preferred to thoſe kingdomes: the good father ſaith nothing. There is one who hath written a booke of the Bathes in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: and as I remember (for it is long ſince I ſaw the booke) the author of it, the rather to extol the firſt finder out, of the ſaid Bathes, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might prooue him to be an ancient gentleman, doth ſet downe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:20192:152"/> his petigree, and neuer leaueth it (I aſſure you) vntill he come to theſe words: which was the ſonne of <hi>Seth,</hi> which was the ſonne of <hi>Adam.</hi> It were not amiſſe in my poore opinion, that Maſter <hi>Parſons</hi> ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſeeke out for this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s kinred. It is not vnlikely, but that by his skil, he might intitle them to very many kingdomes; diſtributing this to one, and that to another, as in his omnipotentencie he ſhould hold it moſt conuenient. The man if he liue long will prooue mad in the end without queſtion: except you can imagine that theſe and ſuch like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities are ſober conceits. And yet that which he ſaith againſt the blood royall of England, to aduance a pretended intereſt to the <hi>Infanta</hi> of Spaine, is more intollerable then theſe ſuch idle ſpeculations before mentioned. For it is grounded not only vpon the ſaid moſt ſottiſh ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation againſt all the kings that liue; but likewiſe vpon a moſt ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous &amp; traiterous lie, in making all the kings &amp; Queenes that haue been for aboue two hundred yeeres in this land, to haue bene vſurpers, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, traitors and I wot not what. And that which doth not a litle moue my patience; this baſtardly Ieſuite doth father this traiterous aſſertion vpon that worthy perſon Cardinal <hi>Allane,</hi> from whom I durſt be ſworn he neuer had them, nor ſo vile a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit euer harbored in his breſt. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt I haue bene diuers times thinking of this fellowes writings touching theſe &amp; ſuch like matters: I haue wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred with my ſelfe how poſſibly he could be ſo blind, as not to foreſee: that when kings ſhould vnderſtand, what a plot he hath laid for the ouerthrow of all authority, by ſetting vp and aduancing a popular furie: they ſhould find thereby verie iuſt cauſe giuen vnto them, to deteſt both him and all the generation of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, or any other catholikes whoſoeuer, that ſhould teach or defend ſuch bloodie &amp; traiterous doctrine. But I haue ſtood too long vpon this point: if you can procure Maſter <hi>Charles Pagets</hi> booke againſt father <hi>Parſons,</hi> you ſhall finde the foxe ſo vncaſed and left ſo naked of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, wiſedome or iudgement touching theſe points: as you may well thinke my paines herein to haue beene needleſſe, except you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that my drift is onely to let you vnderſtand, that father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and his fellowes are great intermedlers with matters of ſtate, and ſucceſſion eſpecially, concerning the Engliſh crowne, which when they ſhall be out of all hope euer to obtaine: I am verily perſwaded there will ſome of them run mad about it; they are ſo extremely egar vpon it: and in ſuch a deſperate iealouſie and feare of looſing it. And therefore will I proceede therein a little further by his Maſterſhips leaue. For as the ſaid father <hi>Parſons</hi> hath laide his plot when England ſhall be Spaniſh: how the ancient lawe of this realme ſhall be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the ciuill law aduanced in the place thereof: ſo hath the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent gentleman another treatiſe of reformation in ſtore, how to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh amongſt vs when that time ſhall come, the ancient lawe termed
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:20192:152"/> 
                     <hi>Lex Agraria.</hi> Bicauſe that (as it ſeemeth) his maſterſhip is of opinion, that the nobilitie of England haue too large and great poſſeſſions: and therefore by one of his rules, in the ſaid reformation: their abilities and what they ſhall yeerely ſpend, muſt be limited vnto them: as alſo what retinue they ſhall keepe, and what their diet ſhall be. The like courſe he hath alſo ordained for the Biſhops and clergie: they muſt be put to their penſions, and the ouerplus is to be at the direction of the Ieſuits: to be imploied by the appointment of their Generall reſident alwaies in Rome <hi>propter bonum ſocietatis</hi> and <hi>ordine ad Deum.</hi> Of all which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, although I haue told you in part before; yet they comming ſo fitly to hand, as beſt agreeing to this <hi>Quodlibet</hi> of ſucceſſion: they can doe no harme to be repeated againe. But now, if any man thinke it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that theſe fellowes ſhould be thus bewitched with theſe vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits: let him but conſider the nature of pride, ambition and libertie, into what a fooles paradiſe they are able to caſt any manner of perſons or profeſſions, that are poſſeſſed with them. They can hardly thinke of any thing, but they account themſelues woorthy of it: and able by their wits to effect it, euen the very ſupreme power and church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſuch is their ambition. And for their libertie they are men exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iuriſdiction of all the ſuperiors of the clergie; ſauing to their owne officers, whereby as lawleſſe libertines, they write, doe and ſay what they liſt, and dreame of (I know not what) Ieſuiticall monarchie. And thus farre of this generall point, that thoſe men doe not ſlander the Ieſuits, that charge them to be greater ſtatiſts then they would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, and thereby to tranſgreſſe all ancient orders of religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to ſhew themſelues as runnagates and degenerated from their owne profeſſion.</p>

                  <head>THE ANSWERE.</head>
                  <p>I Thinke their courſe therein to be neither profitable nor expedient for the church: but on the contrarie very pernitious and dangerous
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:20192:153"/> and eſpecially in theſe our daies. Firſt, bicauſe I doe not finde that the Apoſtles ſent by our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt to preach the Goſpell, did inculcate any ſuch matters or points, either of doctrine or policie: yea in their writings (for ought I ſee) there is no ſuch thing expreſſed: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I remember that any hiſtorie doth tell vs of any ſuch courſe; but rather the quite contrarie, to haue beene held by them. Secondly, the heathen kings both before the comming of Chriſt and in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, did ſuppoſe their titles to their kingdomes to bee much more firme: and their ſubiects being both learned and wiſe men, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all humane knowledge and lawes, did thereof aſſure them, terming them to be the verie life and ſoules of their kingdomes. And it was accounted in the primitiue Church, a great ſlaunder to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell &amp; catholike doctrine of the church of Chriſt, when ſome did report that the doctrine of the Chriſtians was iniurious to the empire or ciuill magiſtracy, as tending to the diminiſhing of their right and authority. Thirdly, if either the Apoſtles, in thoſe times, or their ſucceſſors after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Primitiue Church, ſhould haue written or preached of theſe matters, as now the Ieſuites doe: they would out of queſtion, haue beene cut off preſently. It is true: that although they tooke a very mild courſe, yet they indured great perſecutions, and were very many of them put to death. But if they had beene of the Ieſuites ſpirit: it is not probable that any but the Iewes (who had trayterous harts to the Empire) would euer haue indured to haue heard them ſpeake. We ſee that if their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could but deuiſe ſome litle ſhew though moſt falſely, that they touched <hi>Caeſars</hi> authority: it was ſufficient to cry out againſt them, that they were not worthy to liue. Nay how ſought they to haue intangled Chriſt himſelfe, by their queſtion of tribute, which he diſſolued, not like a Ieſuite though <hi>Caeſar</hi> was an Infidell, but as all true Catholike Prieſts ought to doe: ſaying in direct termes giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars</hi> and vnto God that which is his owne of due right. Fourthly, the Apoſtles followed the ſteps of their Maſter. For he being ſuſpected by king <hi>Herode</hi> to aſpire by degrees to the Empire, cleared himſelfe thereof by paying of tribute: and by teaching all other ſubiectes to giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which was <hi>Caeſars</hi> right. Then his Apoſtles after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vnderſtanding that it was commonly conceiued, that the doctrine of the Goſpell taught ſuch points and preceps, as were very preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the ſtate of the Empire and other kings and Princes, they to purge that ſuſpition did ſo oft in their writings commend and extoll the authority of all Emperors, kings, and Princes: ſhewing the ſame to proceede from God himſelfe, and to be his owne ordinance. <hi>Non est potestas niſi à Deo,</hi> ſaid Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to the Romanes. And Ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are ſent from God ſaid Saint <hi>Peter. Ministri Dei ſunt,</hi> thus they taught for the iuſtifying of the Magiſtracy of ſuch as were at that time
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:20192:153"/> Infidels and perſecutors: neuer mentioning that thereby they had loſt their Empire or kingdomes, or that they might iuſtly be depoſed, or any ſuch matter as our Ieſuites in the like caſe doe now a daies affirme. Fiftly, the holy Fathers of the Primitiue Church, following the Apoſtles, as they followed Chriſt: when they found that (through the malice of Sathan) the ſame obiections (amongeſt many other) were ſtill inſiſted vpon againſt the Chriſtians and their doctrine, as if all had tended to the impeachment of the Monarchy and treachery towards the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: they bent themſelues to refell thoſe ſlaunderous imputations. <hi>Iuſtinus Martyr, Athenagoras,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſucceedingly did write diuers diſcourſes, and ſome to the Emperors themſelues: wherein they acknowledged as much as the Apoſtles had taught them. And thus theſe auncient fathers ſaid of the authority of their Emperors: being ſtill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and perſecutors: <hi>Noster est magis Caeſar vt à nostro Deo conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> Loe, we (quoth <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologie) haue more intereſt in <hi>Caeſar</hi> then the heathen; bicauſe he is appointed Emperor by our God, and not by the falſe Gods, whom they worſhip. The name of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>à Deo traditur; Dicam plane Imperatore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> I will plainely call the Emperor my Lord and Maſter. <hi>Inde est Imperator, vnde est, &amp; homo antequam Imperator, inde potestas illi, vnde &amp; ſpiritus.</hi> He that made him a man, made him an Emperor: from him he hath his authority, who gaue vnto him life. <hi>Sciunt, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſtians know, who giueth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors authoritie, and that they are in their Empires, <hi>à Deo ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di; post quem primi.</hi> The ſecond perſon to God himſelfe and next him the firſt. With <hi>Tertullian</hi> the other two fathers before named, doe in effect very fully agree: whoſe doctrine you ſee doth no way ſound like the aforeſaid tune of Ieſuitiſme. Sixtly, I haue not read all the reſt of the auncient fathers: ſome of them I haue: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by mine owne reading haue I found, nor euer heard it repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any of credit, that the ſaid fathers did in their times, either preach or write any otherwiſe of the authority of magiſtrates, although Infidels and perſecutors, nay Apoſtataes: then as you haue heard Chriſt, his Apoſtles, <hi>Iuſtinus Martyr, Athenagoras,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tertullian</hi> did. I wil only trouble you with S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who is moſt plaine; That whether the king be good or bad, milde or tyrannous, bountiful to the church or a perſecutor: one that imbraceth the Goſpel &amp; Cath. Roman faith, or is become an Apoſtata, yet they are Gods lieuetenants; their power and ſoueraignty are both from God; of him they hold their kingdomes, &amp; are to be obeyed in all things which are not againſt the law, diuine, and Gods church here militant on earth: as for their paying of tribute, fighting his battels, defending their countries, and ſuch like. Read (if you pleaſe) that which he writeth vpon the 13. Chapter to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and in his fift booke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei. Cap.</hi> 22. and vpon the 124.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:20192:154"/> Pſalme; in which laſt place you ſhal find, that he mantaineth in preciſe termes, that <hi>Iulian</hi> by his Apoſtacy was not held to haue loſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or his right, intereſt and title that be had before vnto it: but obeyed by the Chriſtians <hi>propter Dominum aeternum,</hi> bicauſe the eternal God would haue it ſo. Now, no king be he vitious, a ſchiſmatike or an heretike, can be thought with any reaſon ſo euill, as an Apoſtata. It is woorſe to ſlide from the faith of Chriſt <hi>totaliter,</hi> wholy; then <hi>aliqua ex parte,</hi> as it is apparant in Saint <hi>Thomas.</hi> Seuenthly, I am of his opinion, that as the receiuing of the Catholike faith and Goſpell of Chriſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a priuate man to be a temporall king: ſo the reiecting of the ſame faith, &amp;c. cannot make a king a priuate man. And indeed to my vnderſtanding <hi>(ſaluo ſemper meliori iudicio)</hi> it were againſt all reaſon it ſhould be otherwiſe. As for example <hi>à Simili,</hi> A Farmor being a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man, and hauing the leaſe of a mannor which is not good in lawe, doth receiue the faith of Chriſt, and ſo becommeth a Chriſtian. Were it not an abſurd conceit for any man to thinke, that the receiuing of the Chriſtian faith, ſhould make the ſaid bad leaſe to be ſound and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall? Likewiſe, on the other ſide, the ſaid Farmer, hauing as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent a leaſe (as law can make it) of another mannor, doth returne againe to Paganiſme. It would ſeeme to me as abſurd, if any perſon ſhould imagine that the ſaid leaſe or his right vnto it were thereby any whit impaired. Againe, when men receiue the Goſpell and are baptized (be they kings or priuate men, it altereth not our caſe) they receiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an intereſt to the kingdome of heauen, but no further right to their worldly inheritance then they had before. And ſo alſo for the contrary. If any king or priuate perſon, being a Chriſtian, and withall a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, do fall out of the Catholike church and forſake the faith of Chriſt, it is a ſufficient puniſhment for him to looſe thereby his inheritance and right to the ioyes of heauen, though for his worldly ſtate he be left as the church <hi>(in puris naturalibus)</hi> did finde him. And the ſame is in my iudgement in an other like caſe. If the heire apparant of any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like king or other prince, were either addicted to hereſie, or ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Apoſtata. I being borne to be his ſubiect, would vſe my vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeuour to reclaime him; but if that purpoſe would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with him (which I know God hath appointed to be the ordinary meanes for mens conuerſions) I hold it were a very impious part ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in me or in any other priuate perſon being his ſubiect, if we ſhould ſeeke to preuent him of his right, or if it laye in our powers ſhould take vpon vs to giue it vnto another, were he neuer ſo good a Catholike that had no right thereto. <hi>Iuſtinus Martyr</hi> ſpeaking of the duety of Chriſtians to the ciuill Magiſtrate in thoſe times of Infidels and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, affirmeth that they prayed not onely for the Emperors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but alſo for their ſonnes, that they might ſucceede them in the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:20192:154"/> Empire, <hi>quod aequiſſimum est,</hi> which (ſaith he) is moſt agreeable to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equitie: were they like to prooue as euill as their fathers there is no exceptions of it. The which I rather obſerue to ſhew my diſlike of Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> in this point: who is accuſtomed vpon euery occaſion, when he is in his beſt moode, to affirme that he careth not who it is, from whence he commeth, or what right he hath to the crowne of this kingdome, that when the time commeth ſhall be able to catch it, ſo he be a Catholike.</p>
                  <p>But concerning both this point and the former, leaſt it ſhould be ſaid, that whileſt I would ſeeme to giue a reaſon of that which I haue in hand: I do onely ſhew my opinion, and illuſtrate the ſame with ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, that are of as great vncertainty as that which I propound: I will confirme my opinion with the iudgement of a principall man to whom there will no great exception be taken: and then that which I haue ſaid will prooue to be an argument <hi>ab authoritate.</hi> Thus he writeth, <hi>Soloiure naturali, &amp; diuino non priuatur aliquis Dominio in ſubditos, propter peccatum Apoſtaſiae in fide &amp;c.</hi> If you goe no further then to the law of nature, or to the law of God: no king is depriued from his ſoueraigntie ouer his ſubiects, though it be for the ſin of Apoſtacie from faith. And he giueth a very ſound reaſon for this his aſſertion, <hi>nam fundamentum dominij non est fides, &amp;c.</hi> For faith is not the ground of dominion, but ſome other politike title hauing force by the lawe of nations, of ſucceſſion by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, or of election, or of iuſt acquiſition, by iuſt warre, <hi>Qui tituli poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt etiam manere ſine fide: neque vnquam extat ius aliquod diuinum, quo eiuſmodi tituli eneruantur propter defectionem a ſide:</hi> which titles may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine without faith, neither is there any lawe of God whereby ſuch ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles are impeached for defection from faith. 8. I know that <hi>iure eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtico,</hi> &amp; by the authoritie &amp; ſentence of the Popes holines, much more may be done then here I will ſpeake of. But yet I thinke it wil prooue in the end the beſt courſe, for men not to do ſo much as they may. Many things be lawfull which are not expedient. And this Ieſuiticall courſe of downe with princes, when they offend them, may peraduenture ſo prouoke them, as they will ſay as faſt downe with prieſts, and of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty we ſhall haue the woorſe. When they finde that the titles of their kingdomes cannot be touched, either by the lawe of nature or by the lawe of God, do what they liſt, it may giue them occaſion to oppoſe themſelues with greater ſeueritie againſt the See Apoſtolike, in that the ſame ſhould make ſuch extreme lawes voluntarily againſt them, as ſhould tend to the thruſting of them out of their kingdomes. And out of queſtion it will be ſubiect (if once they take this courſe) to great iangling, whether ſuch lawes as ſhould touch the depoſing of a king, are not rather to be accounted lawes ciuill and temporall, then any matter or ſubiect fit for eccleſiaſticall men or lawes to worke vpon.

And will it not ſeeme a thing much more plauſible &amp; probable: if other kings ſhall ſtand vpon it, and ſay; that his holines hath no intereſt to make any ciuill or temporall lawes, that may touch their freeholds? Nay if things ſhould come to this rifling, I feare they would in their heat goe further, and tell his holines, that for ought they finde, kings haue as great authority to depoſe prieſts, as prieſts haue to depoſe kings. Beſides it muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed, that all prieſts, Ieſuits, and euery other ſort of clergie men (the Popes holines excepted) are borne ſubiects of kings and princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it will be an odious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion to ſay, that the taking of prieſthood vpon them, ſhould giue them warrant to briſtle, and make head againſt their ſoueraignes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, it cannot be denied (ſhift the Ieſuits with all their cunning neuer ſo prettily) but the immunities which prieſts haue from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall lawes of kings, doe proceede (as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> acknowledgeth) from their meere fauour and godly zeale towards them. Alſo it is moſt manifeſt, that as the kings of England haue beene moſt bountifull to the church and churchmen here within their dominions, in ſo much as all the reuenewes and temporalties with many ſingular priuiledges (which in this realme our forefathers haue enioyed) haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from their moſt princely liberality and authority: ſo ſtandeth the caſe of the clergy in all other kingdomes; which two points would be duly conſidered of in time. For if princes ſhould by the ſame meanes ſeeke to ſpoyle the church, and take from it all her ſaid immunities, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and temporall poſſeſſions: it will little auaile to bring in our diſtinctions how parliaments may giue what they liſt to the church and churchmen, but they can take nothing either from them or from the church. What the power of a parliament is in England, we haue had too great experience, and I ſuppoſe the ſtates in other kingdomes haue the like. And therefore in all pollicie, kings and ſoueraigne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not to be ruffled with, in this Ieſuiticall maner. That which they may pretend, how in theſe their diſcourſes they ayme but at ſome one or two, doth indeed touch all kings, if they incurre the diſpleaſure of his holines. Surely though I humbly acknowledge my ſelfe to be <hi>minimus fratrum meorum,</hi> and neither arrogate to my ſelfe to be of ſuch mature iudgement as many are, nor will preſume to take vpon me ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily on the one ſide, as Father <hi>Parſons</hi> doth on the other (though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnedly God wot) yet I finde many great dangers that may happen to the Catholike Roman church, if theſe violent ſpirits be not in time ſuppreſſed. Such furious inſulting ouer princes will neuer doe good. They may be drawen many waies by gentle and milde proceedings with them, rather then by ſuch indiſcreete and deſperate courſes,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:20192:158"/> whereby they grow to greater reſiſtance. For if the Popes holines in times paſt dealt ſo ſharpely (as it ſeemeth with <hi>Baldemarus</hi> king of Denmarke that he writ in this ſort to the ſupreme Paſtor: <hi>Notum tibi facimus, vitam nos habere à Deo: nobilitatem à parentibus: regnum à ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis: fidem ab eccleſia Romana: quam ſi nobis inuides remittimus per preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> Be it knowen vnto thee, that we haue our life from God: our nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from our parents: our kingdome from our ſubiects: our religion from the church of Rome: the which if you maligne vs for it, we ſende you backe againe by theſe preſents: then what ſhall we thinke? or can we imagine that ſoueraigne princes of this our infortunate age will brooke it well, to finde his holines to be <hi>tam durus Pater</hi> towards them? But for meane ſubiects to preſume as the Ieſuits do: neuer was it, and now is it leaſt tolerable.</p>

                  <p>THat this is a moſt dangerous doctrine, and moſt vnfit to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in this age: there is no one Catholike in England this day, but, I thinke, will confeſſe it: and therefore I hold it meet before I come directly to anſwer this Article. Firſt, to make it appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the Ieſuites and their ſeditious faction do broach &amp; publiſh ſuch a kind of doctrine: for otherwiſe it might well ſeeme a ſlaunder malitiouſly imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Amongſt others, father <hi>Parſons</hi> in his admonition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, giueth this reaſon, why the Popes ſentence hath not beene put in execution ſince it was firſt giuen, bicauſe (forſooth) <hi>her Maiesties forces were ſo great, that they could hardly be reſisted by the onely Inhabitants of the Realme, without euident daunger and deſtruction of very many and noble perſons &amp;c. in which caſe the cenſures of the Church doe not binde:</hi> which is as much to ſay, as if they had beene of might ſufficient, they had been bound to haue put the ſaid ſentence in execution againſt her highnes, and the ouerthrow of the whole ſtate and common wealth of their natiue land. The ſame Ieſuite alſo in his booke intituled <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi> is very peremptorie, ſly, and ſawcie (as his manner is) very boldly affirming, that when kings doe deflect from the Catholike religion and drawe others with them. <hi>Liberes eſſe ſubditos, &amp;c. poſſeque &amp; debere (ſi vires habeant) buiuſcemodi homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dominatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eijcere.</hi> Subiectes are free
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:20192:159"/> and both may and ought (if they be able) to caſt ſuch a man out of his dominions. Secondly, when <hi>Henry</hi> the third of Fraunce had procured the death of the Duke of Guiſe and ſome other (whereunto the French writers doe affirme he was compelled except he would haue ſuffred the Duke to haue puld the Crowne from his head) it was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but that by the ſecret practiſes of the Ieſuites he himſelfe was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. And not reſting thus contented: they writ ſuch a diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him being a Catholike, as if it had beene hatched in hell: intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>De iusta abdicatione, H.</hi> 3. In which treatiſe they affirme, that it is lawfull for a priuate man to kill a tyrant (for ſo they termed that king) though there be neither ſentence of the Church or kingdome againſt him. Now in this booke (to come to my purpoſe) he propoundeth this obiection: how and why it was, that in the Primitiue Church the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs attempted no ſuch courſe againſt the tyrants that then raigned, and doth anſwere it in this ſort: <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

I leaue to others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite theſe things in as good ſence as may make for our generall ſafety and common good of the Catholike cauſe: onely I wiſh ſuch paſſages had neuer fronted any Engliſh Port, nor come to our aduerſaries eares or knowledge. And an other Ieſuite to the ſame purpoſe ſaith. <hi>Quod ſi Chriſtiani olim non depoſuerunt Neronem &amp; Diocletianum &amp; Iulianum Apoſtatam, ac Valentem Arrianum &amp; alios: id fuit quia de erant vires tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porales Chriſtianis. Nam alioquin iure potuiſſent hoc facere.</hi> In that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in times paſt did not depoſe <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:20192:159"/> Apoſtata, and <hi>Valence</hi> the Arrian and others: it was bicauſe Chriſtians did then want temporall forces, for otherwiſe they might lawfully haue dealt ſo with them. Now what thinke you if ſuch a doctrine had been heard or ſpoken of in <hi>Iulians, Neroes,</hi> or <hi>Diocleſians</hi> daies: what thinke you would haue enſued thereof? Queſtionleſſe, though the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were great, yet probably it would haue beene double increaſed and augmented thereby. And as for the ſcholemen, which they alleage for this doctrine, one and the chiefe is S. <hi>Thomas</hi> who hath ſome ſuch point. <hi>For Chriſtians</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>obeyed Iulianus. Quod illo tempore Eccleſia in ſua nouitate nondum habebat poteſtatem terrenos principes coercendi, &amp; ideo tollerauit fideles Iulano Apoſtatae ohedire in ijs quae non erant contra fidem vt maius periculum fidei vitaretur, &amp;c.</hi> Bicauſe the Church then being in her infancy had not yet power to bridle Princes, and therefore ſhe did tollerate the faithfull to obey <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata in thoſe things which were not againſt faith, for the auoyding of a greater daunger, which might otherwiſe haue inſued to the Chriſtian faith. The other is <hi>Dominus Bannes</hi> vpon Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> who alleaging that the cauſe why catholikes in England do not rebell againſt her Maieſtie, is: <hi>Quia facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem non habent, &amp;c.</hi> Both whoſe opinions and words as they may carry a diuerſe conſtruction: ſo were they not ſet downe by either of them as concluſions, but as argumentall reaſons of doctrine diſputatiue in the ſchooles. Which no queſtion if they had liued in our daies, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnder Englands alleageance they would either haue forborne, or that ſpeach haue qualified. Touching <hi>Bannes</hi> though of this age, yet a Spaniard he was, and therefore his doctrine is leſſe ſtrange for this point. But let that paſſe. I blame him not for holding what opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he liſt diſputatiue: bicauſe it is an ordinary matter ſo to doe, yea and that in pointes of very great importance; one ſcholeman hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an opinion in matters that are not directly of faith, quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and againſt one an other. And ſo could I well haue borne with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons</hi> (if a ſchooleman, as he is not, he had beene) to haue hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den what opinion he liſted, in the ſchooles or for diſputations ſake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the conueniency or inconueniency of publiſhing this doctrine. Marry withall I wiſh from my hart that he had left it there ſtil, &amp; buried it in ſilence vnder his deske that it had neuer come within ken of an Engliſh eye, nor within the ſound of our aduerſaries iealous eares. But ſeeing that publiſhed it is by them, and that in an other &amp; worſe ſenſe then either S. <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>Bannes</hi> euer dreamed of; as tending wholy to a Puritanes popularity, as hereafter ſhall be proued: therefore muſt it needes follow to be a moſt pernitious doctrine and very vnfit to haue beene publiſhed to the world, in theſe ſo dangerous times as wherein we all doe liue. And by conſequent it neceſſarily muſt and ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and father <hi>Parſons</hi> iuſtly conuinced of treaſon and error for
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:20192:160"/> publiſhing of it, like a right Puritane which I prooue by this diſcourſe following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Buchanan</hi> that archtraytor of Scotland, in his booke <hi>De iure regni apud Scotos,</hi> hath written at length to this very purpoſe: againſt whom maſter <hi>Blockwood</hi> a woorthie man and a ſound catholike, did very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly oppoſe himſelfe, and hath at large confuted this monſtrous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite very ſubſtantialy. All the <hi>Buchanans</hi> and Ieſuits in Chriſtendome will neuer be able to anſwere him in that point. When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (ſaith <hi>Buchanan</hi> as maſter <hi>Blockwood</hi> alleageth his words) commaunded the Romanes to obey the ſuperior powers appointed by God he writ ſo, <hi>In ipſa naſcentis eccleſiae infantia, cum chriſtiani, nec numero, nec opibus, nec au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate valerent, ac proinde eorum duntaxat ad quos ſcribebat, non autem vniuerſorum ciuium rationem habuiſſe:</hi> In the infancie of the church (ſaith this ſacrilegious traytor, to ſacred Maieſtie euer blaſphemous:) Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians flouriſhed not either in number, or in wealth, or in authoritie: and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had onely reſpect of thoſe to whom he writ, (that were not able to rebell) and ment not that his precept ſhould be held for a perpetuall lawe, when Chriſtians ſhould grow afterwards to be of greater force. Would not a man thinke he had heard a Ieſuite all this while. But let <hi>Buchanan</hi> go forward. In thoſe times Chriſtians were faine to ſhrowd or hide themſelues vnder the obedience of princes and magiſtrates though they were wicked, and vnder the ſhadow of any kinde of dominion whatſoeuer: bicauſe they were poore: few of them citizens, but ſtrangers: and for the moſt part ſuch as had beene bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the reſt trades men, and ſeruants that with great toile ſuſtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelues. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſhed them <hi>vt temro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri ſeruirent:</hi> that they ſhould diſſemble for the time being mindfull of their condition, and not peepe out of their holes, much leſſe ſeeke to trouble thoſe that were in authority. But if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> liued now adaies when not onely the people but princes do profeſſe Chriſtianitie: and when Chriſtians are equall both in number and ſtrength to match ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants: he would command the multitude to inquire into the ſaide ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants proceedings, and as they ſaw cauſe to put them to death. Thus far this Scottiſh bloodſucker, and enimie to all regal ſoueraignty: to whom father <hi>Parſons</hi> and the ſaid Ieſuits that writ of the depoſition of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. are exceedingly beholden. For he in his booke of ſucceſſion, and the other in their ſaid diſcourſe, do follow him vp and downe, ſtep by ſtep ſo directly, as if they had purpoſed to haue profeſſed themſelues to be his ſchollers, and to defend whatſoeuer he hath written, were it neuer ſo deſperate, impious, prophane, and more then heatheniſh. Thus you heare what the Ieſuits doctrine is, and how iumpe, turne Turke, and Puritane like, they haue proceeded therein. Now follow their grounds. For the grounds and foundation of this Ieſuiticall and Puritane doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:20192:160"/> of obedience, till ſubiects haue force to rebell: you may pleaſe to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it is built vpon a new fond expoſition of the Scriptures: as partly you haue heard, which is a very dangerous point, and will giue our common aduerſaries exceeding aduantage againſt vs: in that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we haue pretended to follow in all matters of controuerſie with them, that ſence of the Scriptures which was generally receiued by the ancient fathers, and haue greatly inueighed againſt their new expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: whereby they wring at woorſt the written word, that it may ſeeme to ſpeake no other wiſe then they would haue it. And that now the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in this caſe doe runne the ſame courſe it is manifeſt. In teſtimonie whereof: whereas the example of the Iewes by <hi>Ieremies</hi> direction vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> hath beene generally held for a preſident for all chriſtians: (if euer they ſhall happen to come into the like bondage) ſo the practiſe of Chriſt concurring with it, in paying tribute to <hi>Caeſar</hi> a wicked king, and commanding all men to do the like: and with this precept alſo the rules of the Apoſtles fitly agreeing in preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing all Chriſtians of what calling ſoeuer generally to obey and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all duties of ſubiects to all ſuperior powers, and particularly to kings, as thoſe being more excellent then the reſt (the ciuill magiſtrates being then likewiſe wicked perſons and perſecutors:) adding hereunto the generall expoſitions of the auncient fathers. That the Apoſtles do ſpeake in thoſe places of ſuch kinde of ciuill gouernors as heere we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of: and that all Chriſtians if they happen to liue vnder ſuch like kings, are to obey them, and to ſubmit themſelues vnto all their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and lawfull commaundements it is cleere: yet all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, out come theſe new illuminates the Ieſuits, and as if they were become Caluiniſts, they take vpon them with their new gloſſes to auoide and elude the true ſence and ancient interpretations of all theſe places. <hi>The Iewes</hi> (ſay they) <hi>were commanded</hi> diuinitus <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to obey and pray for</hi> Nabuchodonozor: <hi>which ordinarily bindeth not: Chriſt paide tribute, and ſpake as a priuate perſon. The Apoſtle Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ment that his precepts ſhould be generally vnderſtoode of obedience to good kings onely: and Saint</hi> Peter <hi>when he commandeth all Chriſtians to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the king,</hi> quaſi praecellenti: that is (ſaith one) <hi>when the king doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in vertue and not otherwiſe:</hi> and father <hi>Parſons</hi> in his booke of titles (omit his abſurd Appendix, wherein he runneth riot in this point of rebellion and popularitie) ſaith: that where Salomon affirmeth: <hi>By me kings raigne: and Saint</hi> Paul <hi>auoucheth that authoritie is not but of God: and therefore he that reſiſteth authoritie reſiſteth God: theſe places are to be vnderſtood of authoritie, power, or iuriſdiction in it ſelfe according to the firſt inſtitution: for otherwiſe when it is vniustly vſed, it may be reſisted in manie caſes euen by the commons or multitude:</hi> whom in his Appe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dix he bindeth in conſcience to rebell &amp;c. which kinde of ſhifts we haue euer deteſted:
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:20192:161"/> and therefore nowe you ſhall heare what we thinke of this doctrine. To ſpeake plainely my minde in this caſe, with all humble ſubmiſſion to the Catholike church and cenſure of my opinion herein. I hold this doctrine of the Ieſuits in theſe daies to be an open way to Atheiſme, ſo to expound the Apoſtles as that they might be thought to temporize, which is a plaine kinde of diſſimulation. For there being queſtion made concerning the doctrine of the Catholike church and Goſpel of Chriſt, as though it had impeached the authority of the ciuill Magiſtracie: the Apoſtles to cleare themſelues of ſo falſe an imputation did of purpoſe propoſe the contrary, and preſcribed ſuch obedience and duty to all ſubiects, as was by the lawes of God and all nations due vnto them. But if the Apoſtles had beene of the Ieſuits opinion in this matter, and would haue dealt truely, ſincerely and directly (as the Ieſuits do neuer) when ſuch a doubt was made by the States where they preached: they ſhould haue anſwered to this effect, <hi>ſcil.</hi> If you that are Emperors, kings, and worldly gouernours doe meane to continue your wicked courſes in oppoſing your ſelues againſt Chriſt and vs his ſeruants, we are (by the doctrine of our Maſter Chriſt and authoritie committed vnto vs) to ſeeke your confuſion, and to depriue you from your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, kingdomes and gouernments as ſoone as we are able to make head againſt you: or if any of you will be content to heare and obey vs: we muſt tell you that, wherunto you muſt truſt, which is; that when once you haue ſubmitted your ſelues to this our ſaid doctrine, If you ſhall not foreuer afterwards conforme your behauiour and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to our rules and preſcription, we muſt be bold with you, and do the beſt we can to mooue your ſubiects to rebellion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you likewiſe as ſoone as they ſhall haue competent ſtrength to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with you: and in default thereof, it is our duety to perſwade by all the policies we can deuiſe, ſome of your neighbour princes to take your ſubiects parts for your vtter ruine. <hi>Inter bonos bene agere oportet,</hi> We profeſſe our ſelues to be teachers of the truth, and therefore we cannot chuſe being vrged vnto it in this particular: but to ſignifie the truth vnto you, after our plaine and direct proceedings with all men.</p>
                  <p>Now if ſuch a kinde of anſwere to haue beene made by the Apoſtles do ſeeme moſt abſurd, then what wicked and abſurd wretches are theſe good fathers, who by their interpretations do impoſe it vpon them, if they had dealt ſincerely? Or if the Apoſtles ſhould haue meant indeed as theſe men would haue them, and as it is before expreſſed; then what might the world haue thought of them, that (to couer ſuch tragicall points of blood and rebellion and to abuſe princes: they did pretend nothing but prayers, paying of tributes, honoring of kings, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them for conſcience ſake. But this courſe was farre from the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:20192:161"/> Apoſtles. It is indeed very well befitting the puritanes &amp; the Ieſuits, ſuch as <hi>Parſons, Creſwell, &amp;c.</hi> who are the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that teach &amp; practiſe it. For it is their doctrine by diſſimulation &amp; hypocriſie, by lying &amp; equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſeduce their hearers. But what ſaith Maſter <hi>Blockwood</hi> to <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, Paulus vtendum fore precepit? Laruatam hypocriſin ſub perſona religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis latere voluit?

Did he prouoke them to armes when their number and ſtrength ſerued, and bad downe with the Emperor? This is right Mahumetiſme, &amp; tendeth to the ouerthrow of the Goſpel and church Catholike, the ſweete ſpouſe of Chriſt, and therefore is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted <hi>cane peius &amp; angue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, this Ieſuiticall dreame doth derogate ſo much from the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of holy Scripture and the churches authority, as thereby the vanity of it is very manifeſt and apparant.

He is the Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the expounder and the giuer of this lawe: which he that will not obey, is his own enimy, <hi>&amp; maximas poenas luet,</hi> and he ſhal neuer eſcape greeuous puniſhments. And ſuch were Chriſts and his Apoſtles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, not ſubiect to alteration and chaunge, not framed to ſerue the time, not fitted to this or that priuate perſon or plebian multitude, one while commaunding obedience to tyrants, and preſently after to take vp armes againſt them, but as we are to thinke of the very lawes of God, their rules of obedience are permanent, and to continue vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable whileſt this world endureth.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, it is to be ſuppoſed, that the Church of God in the times of <hi>Iustinus Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> did vnderſtand the meaning of Chriſt and of his Apoſtles in this point as well as <hi>Parſons</hi> or any of his crue. But it would haue ſeemed a ſtrange doctrine both to them and all other Catholikes that had the feare of God before their eyes, or any ſparke of true and vnfained Catholike religion in their
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:20192:162"/> harts in thoſe daies: to haue heard it ſet down for poſitiue Diuinitie, that notwithſtanding any thing that Chriſt or his Apoſtles taught as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to kings and Princes: yet it is to be accounted a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and vnſpeakeable ſinne for ſubiectes being of ſufficient force and ability not to reſiſt (for to that effect are father <hi>Parſons</hi> words in his Appendix) and take armes againſt them, if they be euill and wicked. <hi>Inſtinus Martyr</hi> as I haue before obſerued hauing ſet downe the duety of Chriſtians towards the ciuill magiſtrate the Emperor (then a wicked man and a perſecutor) doth in direct termes affirme: that Chriſt had taught them ſuch obedience and alledgeth his very words: giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars.</hi> If it be here obiected that peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> time the Chriſtians wanted number to depoſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. <hi>Tertullian</hi> will make the matter moſt manifeſt: that it was the onely will and pleaſure of God reuealed apparantly by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that kept the Chriſtians within the compaſſe of their duties to the Emperors: when otherwiſe they wanted neither number nor ſtrength to haue beene reuenged of them. When the Chriſtians labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time to purge themſelues from ſundryfalſe imputations, and from this one amongeſt the reſt: that whereas they profeſſed their obedience to the Emperor, it was onely but for feare: and that if they had ſtrength ynough, they would then ſhew themſelues to be his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and take vp armes againſt him. <hi>Tertullian</hi> writeth to this effect. <hi>Neque est vt obijciatis: Neither is there any cauſe you ſhould obiect vnto vs: that therefore we diſſemble the iniuries done vnto vs, bicauſe we want force to reuenge them. For euery one of vs is able although not openly, yet in ſecret to doe miſchiefe ynough, For what were more eaſily done, if it were lawfull to recompence euill with euill, then in the night to burne your City? Nay, if we were diſpoſed to profeſſe our ſelues your enimies as you account vs, we want not ſtrength of ſouldiers, but haue greater force then thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that doe warre dayly against you. The Maures, and Parthians and other barbarous people are but one Nation whoſe borders are limited: but of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinns the number in euery place is almost infinite. There is no place nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der where there are not Christians. So as if by our diſcipline we could take armes, we could make a greater conſpiracie against the Romane Empire then was hitherto euer made: whether you reſpect force or courage.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> as vnlike to our Ieſuites: as dutifull ſubiectes are vnlike Rebels and traitors.</p>
                  <p>And for the better manifeſting of our allegiance to our Soueraigne vnfainedly from our Catholike harts, ſo many of vs as are not of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites faction: I will here a litle enlarge my ſelfe to ſhew what further teſtimony and reaſons we haue to deteſt this Ieſuiticall and Puritanian doctrine. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who liued in a troubleſome time neuer dreamed: that the Scriptures did warrant ſubiectes no longer to obey
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:20192:162"/> wicked kings, then they had power and force to rebell. If he were now aliue, our Ieſuites would ſurely ſet him to ſchoole againe. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in his expoſition vpon the 124. Pſalme, he hath at large diſcourſed: how ſeruants and ſubiectes by receiuing the Catholike faith and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Chriſt, are not in any ſort releaſed from their dueties, ſeruices, and ſubiection to their Maſters, Lords, &amp; Soueraignes, but are rather thereby more ſtraightly bound to performe the ſame diligently, truly, and faithfully, as in the ſight of God before whom they ſtand: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to this obiection: <hi>Sed numquid ſic erit ſemper? vt iniusti imperent iustis. But ſhall it be ſo alwaies? Shall the wicked ſtill haue commaundement ouer the rest.</hi> To this obiection you know what father <hi>Parſons</hi> would ſay, viz. No it ſhall not be ſo any longer, then that you ſhall be able to ouerthrow ſuch gouernors and get you better. And if in ſhort time you ſhall not be able your ſelues ſo to doe: I will doe my vttermoſt to procure you ſome aſſiſtance out of other Countries, by forraigne inuaſions, procuring excommunications, ſuſpenſions, interdictions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and other meanes. But to omit this vnnaturall ſtepfather, let vs heare what S. <hi>Augustine</hi> (that worthy Prelate, light, lanterne, piller, and Father of, and in the Catholike Church) will anſwere to the ſaid obiection. <hi>Nunquid ſic erit ſemper? Shall it alwaies be ſo? Non ſic erit, It ſhal not be ſo? But when ſhall it be otherwiſe.</hi> The ſubſtance of his anſwere is: that it ſhall be otherwiſe when Chriſt commeth to iudgement. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we often ſee, that there are many good Lords and maſters: but when it hapneth otherwiſe, it must be borne with. Quare? Why? vt non extendant, &amp;c. that the iuſt may not ſtretch forth their hands to wickednes, &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that ſuch their ſeruice and ſubiection is not euerlaſting: Sed preparent ſe ad poſſidendam ſempiternam haereditatem. And therefore reſeruing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for this lasting inheritance: let them beare iniuries, but doe none.</hi> And his concluſion of all this diſcourſe is in theſe words: <hi>Haec cogitant qui vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem dei ſequuntur, non voluntatem ſuam: who followe Gods will and not their owne.</hi> Now if this were the doctrine of the catholike church in thoſe daies: then how inconuenient this Ieſuiticall innouation is, and howe dangerous to be publiſhed now a daies, the ſtate of al catholiks in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but eſpecially of prieſts, may make it to be euident. For by this wicked aſſertion ſo ſoone as the number of catholiks ſhall be ſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as that they may be able to take armes againſt her Maieſtie, they are bound in conſcience ſo to doe, and do grieuouſly offend if they do otherwiſe: nay they do incurre the Popes excommunication (ſaith fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons.</hi>) Now what muſt her Highneſſe and the ſtate thinke of ſuch ſubiects? doth it not ſtand her in hand to preuent that the number of catholiks do not increaſe? if therefore they doe increaſe faſter then ſhe would, if ſufficient teſtimony be not giuen to the contrarie, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that al are not of this Ieſuiticall faction, &amp; Puritanian opinion: hath ſhe
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:20192:163"/> not good cauſe giuen her to cut them off? I ſpeake after the manner of men: not preſuming to tempt God with miracles. What could any king or prince in Chriſtendome being perſwaded in religion as her Maieſtie is, do otherwiſe: if he ment not to haue the crowne plucked from his head? There is no way to preuent this miſchiefe for ought I know, but that all catholikes do enter into a league and make a vowe, that they neuer will giue care to theſe bloody Ieſuits in that behalfe, but vtterly deteſt it: and that, were their number and ſtrength much more and greater then her Maieſties, they will neuer be perſwaded or drawne, either by threatnings or promiſes of any (be it the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) to beare armes againſt her Highnes, to the deſtruction of her roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſon and ſtate: but be ready to aduenture their goods and liues in her Maieſties defence againſt him or any other that ſhall aſſaile or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade by hoſtile hande her ſtate or kingdome vnder pretence of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the catholike faith or whatſoeuer. Nay, as many catholikes as ſtande affected to the Ieſuits, conſidering how her Highnes hath beene vſed by theſe their falſe teachers: they ſhall thinke themſelues moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely bound to her Maieſtie, if notwithſtanding they ſhall now vowe and profeſſe as is expreſſed: yet that ſhe ſhall be pleaſed to beleeue them: the doctrine of the Ieſuits touching equiuocation hath already bewitched ſo many of them. But principally what are all catholike prieſts that are Ieſuited to looke for vpon the broaching of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and diueliſh conceite? when the catholikes are in number ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient they muſt rebell: and the innocent prieſts are ſent ouer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe this number. Into what perplexities are they hereby caſt? How can they expect any fauor when they are taken? none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny that their comming ouer is to increaſe the number of catholiks: and that father <hi>Parſons</hi> raigneth and hath the whole direction at this day for all the miſſions that are for England. How then (alas) how may her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty &amp; the ſtate conclude againſt them? what lawes can be too extreme to keepe them out of the land? or if they will needs come in: what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity for the execution of lawes againſt them can be more then ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient? Into what gulfe are we plunged? nay into what an obloquie are we plunged? nay into what an obloquie muſt the catholike church of Rome grow, in that the execution of prieſthoode and treaſon are now ſo linked together by the Ieſuits in England, as we cannot exhort any to the catholike faith: but <hi>dogmatizando</hi> in ſo doing we draw him in effect to rebellion? For the mitigation therfore both of her Maieſtie and the ſtate, and that they may deale more mercifully with poore ſecular prieſts: I doe heere profeſſe both for my ſelfe and thoſe that are not Ieſuited (as too many are) that we loath, and deteſt this point of Ieſuitiſme: that if we finde that we can not otherwiſe preuaile, and that ſuch as are catholikes will needes runne into theſe Ieſuiticall cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:20192:163"/> of rebellion and treaſon: we will ſurceaſe from the execution of our functions, and from the increaſing of that number that will will not be aduiſed by vs: with patience and ſuffering to expect the Lords leiſure for the reſtitution of the catholike faith: and in the meane time to obey her Maieſtie as they did in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, and as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth teach vs in lawfull commandements and points perteining to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill gouernment and temporall lawes.</p>

This coſening mate proteſting at the firſt that it was meant no otherwiſe, but ſhe ſhould: afterward when partly by force and feare, partly vpon hope to haue gotten all his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of this fathers hands (who by your leaue (vnder <hi>Benedicite</hi> be it ſpoken, coſened him at the laſt caſt of three hundred pound at leaſt, as we haue beene credibly informed by reuerend prieſts then there, which he neuer could get out of his handes:) he conſented vpon that condition to giue his name to that charter of ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And then loe what the good father added (quoth he) I could wiſh her Ladiſhippe married into England: but they are all too meane, and none to be found worthie within that Iſle by birthe, calling, or any other abilities of ſo royall a Lady as ſhe is. It is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full how this <hi>Protheus</hi> windeth and turneth, now this way, now that way, and with what ſuppoſitions, exceptions, conditions, and quiddities he handleth this point. All which deuiſes &amp; the circumſtances therunto belonging, being with mature iudgement examined, and a thorough reuiew taken of the whole ſcope and marke he ſhutes at, glauncing here and there at the popular authoritie giuen to the ſubiects of this
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:20192:164"/> land to chooſe a king of their owne: doe make it moſt apparant that his, and by conſequent the reſt of the Ieſuites meaning was, and is, if poſſiblie they can bring it to paſſe. Firſt, to deſtroy our whole Nation by aide of the Spaniard, and Auſtrian, Burgundian, Netherlandian, and ſuch like Germaine bred huff muff forces. Secondly, and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brought all into ſubiection, ſlauery and bondage, (eſpecially the auncient nobility and ſecular cleargy, by ſending the former into other countries vnder pretence of aduauncement to higher honors, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the latter as illiterate, vnexperienced and vnfit to gouerne or any way to be aduaunced to the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate) there muſt follow ſuch waighty reaſons mouing aſwell the king catholike, as the Ladie <hi>Infanta</hi> to appoint ſome Regent, Viceroy or other ſubſtitute vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as whether ſoeuer or who elſe beſides winne it by conqueſt, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premiſes, yet none but a Ieſuite ſhall or can be found fitte, <hi>Penes quem imperium,</hi> To haue the whole managing of all cauſes: and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the whole Iſle. Thirdly, the high Counſell of Reformation for England, doth make the caſe moſt cleere, that they aſpire to a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty aboue all theſe Northen Iſles, aſwell in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall as Temporall; as if you pleaſe to peruſe the <hi>Quodlibet</hi> here ſet downe of that matter, you may eaſily perceiue: but more directly if you can get a ſight of the booke it ſelfe. Only this conſider by the way, that the chiefe point there touched being an oeconomicall order ſet downe to appoint all eſtates within what compaſſe they ſhall liue by an Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian law, there is neither Prieſt nor lay perſon from the higheſt to the loweſt in either or any of the three auncient ſtates of this land: but muſt by that high Court of Parliament or Counſell of reformation ſtand at the Ieſuites deuotion to fleete and ſwymme which way, and as their fatherhoodes will haue them, ſo as a Ieſuit muſt be <hi>Dominus fac totum,</hi> in all theſe northerne Iſles. Fourthly, the inſtitution of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt is in ſuch forme in their pretence: as it can not denotate leſſe then a ſupremacy in time to come ouer this whole Iſle of England, Scotland, and Wales, and by conſequent then ouer Ireland as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to England. For otherwiſe to what end is it that Maſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> ſhould haue as full and ample iuriſdiction ouer all Scotland, as he hath ouer England, conſidering that they haue a catholike Biſhop of their owne countrie and nation? And withall, to what purpoſe is it that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine prieſts of late comming out of Spaine, ſhould be more vrged, then others were to obey him in what he ſhould commaund: he ſtill himſelfe notwithſtanding being at the Ieſuites deuotion to ſtand or fal, and at their appointment and direction to command, when, what, and where they will haue him. Fiftly, the moſt egregious, tyrannicall, vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, intruſiue authority of the Ieſuites gotten ouer all the Seminaries at Rome: at Saint Omars, in Spaine, and at Deway (for euen the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:20192:165"/> there, is but a ſubiect, ſeruant or (ſome terme him the vaſſall of father <hi>Parſons</hi>) adding hereunto the like intendment for England, in plotting to haue had father <hi>Edmonds</hi> head of the afflicted Church in Dureſſe, and father <hi>Garnet</hi> the ſupreme head of all the prieſts and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes liuing abroad at liberty; and both theſe then being but ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate vnder <hi>Parſons,</hi> he directing, appointing, and commaunding all both here and there as he liſt and as the generall and his fatherhood ſhall iudge: what elſe can this denotate, then an abſolute intendement of a Ieſuiticall monarchy. Sixtly, the preſumed plea they take vpon them againſt the ſecular prieſts on his behalfe attributing vnto him, <hi>Per argumentum è contra,</hi> The title of a Soueraigne: by calling the ſaid ſeculars and all that appeale from him, rebels, &amp;c. Which word how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it may improperly be applyed to any inferiour, reſpecting his reſiſting of a Superiour; yet the common phraſe of ſpeach is, to vſe that word onely as a traiterous act or attempt of a ſubiect againſt his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, And therefore doe we call traitors rebels: when they riſe by reſiſtance or inpugnance of their Princes authority, lawes, orders, or decrees. Whereas if it be but againſt ſome noble or other priuat or publike perſon: we call it a commotion, a ryot, quarrels, a fray, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, &amp;c. But treaſon, rebellion, ſedition, and faction, doe alwaies preſuppoſe ſuch a ſuperior as hath none aboue him in that ſtate, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and condition of life wherein he liues as Soueraigne, and thoſe that rebell, &amp;c. as ſubiectes vnder him. Foraſmuch therefore as we iuſtly terme the Ieſuites traytors, rebels, ſeditious and factious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not in regard of the contention that is betwixt them and vs for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie (which they vainely arrogate to themſelues ouer the ſeculars reſiſting their proud attemptes, plots, &amp; deuiſes that way) but in reſpect of their tampering in ſtate matters, oppoſing themſelues againſt their natiue Prince and Countrey, and practiſing the vtter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this land, by ſtirring vp both forraigne powers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade and home borne ſubiectes to riſe in armes, adding hereunto their many libelles, ſlaunderous and infamous ſpeaches in preiudice and againſt both Pope and Prince, church &amp; common wealth &amp; both ſtates: This being that acte and thoſe proceedings which make traytors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, factious and ſeditious perſons indeed: they ſtill crying Whoreſon firſt in a contrary ſenſe, bicauſe (forſooth) we would not be obedient to the Archprieſt, euen iumpe in the Ieſuiticall meaning, pretence, and action: therefore are we called rebels, ſeditious, factious, &amp;c. By which words they plainely attribute a ſoueraignty to Maſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for cauſes eccleſiaſticall againſt and aboue the Popes holines: and for cauſes temporall ouer and againſt her Maieſtie. And although that this be an ordinary paſſage amongſt them to call all that are not currants of Maſter <hi>Blackwels</hi> courſe, factious, ſeditious, &amp;c. Yet of all the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:20192:165"/> reſt, there is one Ieſuite Fa. <hi>Holt</hi> by name, who vſeth this word Rebell more then any or all the reſt of his fellowes, in a moſt arrogant prowde conceited letter of his to a very woorthy Catholike Lady of ſpeciall note, name and eſteeme, as wel for her calling, birth and abilities in gifts of nature and fortune: as alſo for her rare vertues, religious piety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and other indowments and graces abounding in all workes of charity. Whom how this factious Ieſuite (one of the right ſtampe) hath be laboured with his pen to winne vnto his byace, and to bring her Ladiſhip in diſlike of the ſecular prieſts (as others haue ſought, but all alike preuayled, ſhe being both too wiſe, conſtant, and vertuous to be carried away with gloſes) you would maruell that euer any bearing the face of a religious man would write ſo exorbitantly as he there hath done) to his vtter ſhame and diſcredit, as you ſhall well perceiue when it once comes foorth in Print with the diſcouery of his arrogancy, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp; lies on the one ſide: and of his malice, ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous toong, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the ſecular prieſts on the other ſide. But to returne to our former ſpeech: Theſe circumſtances of <hi>Parſons</hi> actions and names giuen to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, demonſtrating a ſoueraigntie or ſuperioritie in cheefe to be in Maſter <hi>Blackwell:</hi> it followeth that he being notwithſtanding all this ſubordinate, or (for feare or want of wit, experience and knowledge due to ſuch a ſuperior: as he takes vpon him to be) at the command of Fa. <hi>Garnet,</hi> betwixt whom by a prieſt of their owne faction, it hath been told that there is continuall intercourſe once in euery 24. howers at leaſt: there can no leſſe be aymed at by the Ieſuits in this Iſle, then a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power imperialty and dominion ouer all. And ſo I conclude that they ayme at the ſucceſſion themſelues to rule vnder the Spaniards, or rather to cloake their intended ambitious aſpires vnder the Spaniards wings a while, vntill they haue gotten all ſubiected vnder them. <hi>Sed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat Hiſpania praelio, partu, venditur proelis fides.</hi>

For afterward great calamities are we ſure to ſee, ſo many as liue to that wofull hower by all probable coniecture. And by conſequent then it followeth, that England is the onely butte, marke, and white, they aime at; as well in intention, as in execution of their pretended expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, exployte and action.

This concluſion needes no further, better, nor other proofe, then a relation with aduiſement of this diſcourſe <hi>Quodlibeticall.</hi> Firſt, for that as you may gather by the ſecond reaſon in the laſt Article, and perceiue more at large if you read father <hi>Parſons Dolemanian</hi> ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he bringeth all his chiefe and ſtrongeſt arguments for intituling the Lady <hi>Infanta</hi> to the Engliſh crowne from that head, <hi>ſcil.</hi> for that ſhe is the right heire of Brytaine and France, &amp;c. Now then if ſhe be the heire of France and Brytaine (as in preciſe termes he calleth her in his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi>) and that thereby ſhe be intituled to our Engliſh crowne, then queſtionles if once ſhe get, or (I ſhould haue ſaid) they get poſſeſſion of this Iſle in her right which they aime at in chiefe, their title therunto comming by this meanes, it ſtandes with no ſenſe that they ſhoulde giue ouer their clayme on her graces behalfe to that kingdome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſay ſhe is already heire, hauing obteined that monarchy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhe is intituled by the foreſaide claime of heritage, and whereby withall reciprocally ſhe is againe reintituled to the ſame French king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and crowne. Neither will the law <hi>Salique</hi> keepe them out from aduauncing her royall enſignes in the middeſt of them. For I holde it but for a kindly canuaſe, banding bob, or taunting effect, to confront with France, for Burgundy, Britany, and other ſtates and ſeigniories, of old depending vpon the French crowne: affirming as father <hi>Parſons</hi> doth in <hi>Doleman,</hi> that though by the law <hi>Salique</hi> the Lady <hi>Infanta</hi> may be defeated and put from her rightfull title of inheritance, and lawfull claime to the whole kingdome of France, in <hi>concreto,</hi> or in <hi>ſenſu compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> (as a man may terme it) yet no reaſon ſaith he there, but that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtates &amp; prouinces as came to the crowne of France by heires gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or women, but that the ſame ſhould diuolue vnto the Spaniard by women heires againe. Which if he can bring to paſſe (for all thoſe ſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories come by women) then ſhall the French be ſo fleeced in <hi>abſtracto</hi> or in <hi>ſenſu diuiſo,</hi> as let them reſt aſſured, to be diſtracted out of their wits ere the Spaniſh Ieſuiticall faction haue left them: vnleſſe they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:20192:166"/> vp the whole into their hands, and yeelde perforce to abrogate the authoritie of their <hi>Salique</hi> lawes, it holding no way either in piety or policie with father <hi>Parſons</hi> principles, that taking vpon him in his ſaid booke of titles and high counſell of reformation, to aboliſh vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the auncient municipall lawes of this lande, which were eſtabliſhed by higheſt authoritie, then the lawe <hi>Salique</hi> of France, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euer the ſaide lawe was heard of amongſt them, that they ſhould not tender, thruſt vpon and compell the French, to chaunge their forme of gouernment, lawes, cuſtomes, and all at his deſignement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, although during the time of their (I meane the Ieſuits) rebellious practiſes &amp; conſpiracies againſt the laſt king <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. of France, of the houſe of Valois, and this king regnant <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore king of Nauarre:) it was not directly knowne that the Ieſuits had caſt at the crowne and whole kingdome of France in thoſe warres then maintained by aide of the Spaniard: but as a great part of catholikes heere in England in former broiles and conſpiracies as well by the dukes of Norfolke, and of Guiſe, as alſo by captaine <hi>Stukeley</hi> and doctor <hi>Saunders</hi> aided with Italians, and Spaniards, &amp;c. and finally by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in the yeere 1588. did thinke that the Ieſuits and their faction had done all of zeale (though indiſcretely) and for the aduancement of Gods glory and the catholike cauſe pretended by them to be religion. So the French catholikes many of them of ignorance folowing the parts of Spaine and other rebels againſt their Soueraigne and country by Ieſuiticall perſwaſion, hauing had the like good opinion of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, and thereupon following their direction at an inche, yet ſince their expulſion thence for their treaſons and conſpiracies, vpon more warie and further looking into their dooings, drifts, and plot ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, comparing their infamous libels, letters, paſſages, practiſes, purpoſes, and proceedings together, and conferring one thing with an other, heere and there, and in all other nations, kingdomes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces where they come and can get footing (as now in Sweuia the caſe is cleere, how the Polonian king is defeated of that kingdome, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated only by their treacherous, ambitious tampring aſpires) ſundry of ſound iudgement and of the grauer, more politike and wiſer ſorte amongſt them that are not ledde away with paſſion or affection fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then reaſon, lawe, iuſtice, conſcience, and religion, mooues, bindes and compels them for to thinke: are fully perſwaded they eſcaped as great a danger of comming vnder a Ieſuitical bondage, when al France was in a furious combuſtion by them, as euer they or anie other nation did, at what time as the Templars (the ſampler of the Ieſuits often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by me in ſundry places) had confederated with the Turks or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens in a general conſpiracy for the ouerthrow of the whole chriſtian world &amp; of France in chiefe. And therefore as that moſt Chriſtian &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:20192:167"/> king great <hi>Henrie</hi> of France now regnant hath iuſt cauſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſtate of France, neuer to admit of the Ieſuits againe to come within his borders, or to like (as the Scots phraſe goeth) within his bounds: ſo maruell not though all that are Ieſuits either <hi>in verbo</hi> or <hi>in voto, in re</hi> or <hi>in ſpe,</hi> or in faction or affection, do mightily grudge, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and euen gnaſh their teeth in the furie of their zeale, with moſt bitter words, reuiling as well the Popes holines as the king Chriſtian, the ſtate, the clergie, the catholikes, and the whole realme of Fraunce, when they heare but the name of that nation, or call to minde what a ſweete morſell was taken out of their iawes, at the reconciliation of the French king to the catholike Romiſh Church: as the onely acte which daſhed their hope for the time of that crowne, fruſtrated their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſpires to that mighty monarchie, and put them halfe in diſpaire of euer obtaining the like meanes of aſpiring to ſoueraigne dominion. Yea I am verily perſwaded it gaue many of the more ambitious ſort amongſt them ſuch a frantike, phanaticall, mad, diſtraction in their wils: as ſeuen yeeres retired exerciſe of contemplation, will hardly bring them to a true mortified religious courſe and ſpirite againe. For had they gotten Fraunce ſubiected vnder the Spaniards at that time, as the tickliſh ſtate of all things ſtood here and elſewhere: (the Spaniſh title and claime to the Engliſh crowne riſing thence as before is ſaid) they would haue had greater poſſibilitie of aduantage, helpes, and meanes by ſize ace and the dice, for the conqueſt of all theſe northerne Iſles then now they haue, or are like hereafter eaſily to be poſſeſſed of: the whole Chriſtian world beginning now daily more and more to looke into them and their treacherous dealings. Thirdly, I might here enlarge my ſelfe with many weightie reaſons to conuince the Ieſuiticall ambition and aſpires to the French crowne and kingdome, as well by ſome ſuſpitious ſpeeches giuen our by their fautors of the cauſes moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the marriage betwixt the Lady <hi>Infanta Iſabella</hi> and the Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> and placing of them both in the Low countries: as alſo by the generall paſſages and the Ieſuiticall faction concerning the houſe of Burgundy, and common applauſes giuen on that behalfe: how mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous deepely affected the Burgundians are to the Engliſh, how hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the French, how woorthy warriors of themſelues: and how that their forces, together with the power of England, and ſtrength which the Lady <hi>Infanta</hi> their ſoueraigne, would bring or ſend vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſome Ieſuiticall General, perchance of Captaine <hi>Cubbocke</hi> were ſufficient to bring both Fraunce and Scotland vnder the Engliſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, as of right they ſhould. Theſe with many other the like perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions vſed by them both to catholikes and others of our common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, ſhew plaine (if a man ponderate euery point, particular, and circumſtance well with himſelfe:) that the Ieſuits aime at all theſe nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:20192:167"/> Iſles, together with the whole kingdome of Fraunce, and by conſequent then theſe once gotten in full poſſeſſion, what kingdome in the world, but <hi>per nullum tempus occurrens regi,</hi> may by degrees come vnder their bowe, bondage and Allobrogicall gouernment.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, this is confirmed not onely <hi>ab inductione,</hi> for euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nation, how many great potentates ſide with them, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond their aduerſaries euery where; but alſo by the meanes they haue to worke that feate withall, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to increaſe their faction by winning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigled ſingle harts vnto them: which they do ſundry waies, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by three deuiſes, that are the cheife aides and hopes of conqueſts, none of which the <hi>Ottomans</hi> had when they began their enterpriſe. One is wit, practiſe, experience and policie (for in vaine are warres abroad, <hi>niſi ſit conſilium domi:</hi>) neither <hi>Matchiuel,</hi> nor any that euer yet was in Europe comming neere vnto the Ieſuits for Atheall deuiſes to preuent the ſtoppels of their ſtratagems, and to further their owne procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. An other is, pretended piety, whereby (through helpe of the former to put their rules and principles in execution in due time and place, reſpecting the perſon and other circumſtances and occaſions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:) they haue and do not onely allure multitudes vnto them day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, encreaſing the number of their faction, but withall, there can be
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:20192:168"/> nothing done nor almoſt intended againſt them, or for the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (by counterplots) of their aduerſaries where euer they liue: but preſently know it, and thereby hauing their ſpials in euery princes court and place of moſt intelligence, that may informe their Generall, as they doe once a moneth ordinarily from all parts of Europe) what is there done or intended with or againſt them; they haue the aduantage by being thus diſperſed to ſaue themſelues from all vniuerſall, or any notable danger. And if poſſibly it can be preuented, or their aduerſaries ouerthrowen in their owne courſes taken againſt theſe fathers, they haue the meanes for it, elſe it is not in the world to be heard of or found. The laſt is, plenty of money, which <hi>Ottoman</hi> alſo wanted. And ſeeing (to ſpeake morally) there is not that exploite to be done, which money cannot compaſſe: then conſider what huge maſſes of money and infinite treaſure the Ieſuits haue euery where. It is credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome reuerend prieſts, as I told you once before; that they loſt at their expulſion out of Fraunce three millions at the leaſt. Adding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto what large collections they make yeerely here in England (which is the leaſt they haue in any other Nation, vnleſſe Scotland, &amp;c.) where they are reſident, little or nothing at all, ſometimes comming to any afflicted Catholike (ſo mercileſſe hard and cruell harts they haue) of many 1000. l. which ſome one of them hath reeceiued, as before is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in part, and more at large in other bookes written of their conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catching deuiſes to get money, is to be found. Then I ſay none euer had fairer meanes or greater helpes and likelyhoods of preuailing in their ambitious aſpires, and affecting of ſoueraigne dominion in an abſolute monarchiall ſtate, then they haue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Ieſuites practiſe is as well againſt Spaine, and by conſequent againſt the whole houſe of Auſtria, and the Empire, as againſt any other Nation: it is apparant by that I told you of in part before concerning Fa. <hi>Parſons,</hi> winding, twinding, doubling and boutgates, in intituling the Lady <hi>Infanta</hi> to the Engliſh crowne, meaning it directly for himſelfe and his ſocietie; as is manifeſt alſo by his ſaid books of ſucceſſion &amp;c. which here you may pleaſe to confirme, as wel by general collections out of the ſame bookes, as likewiſe by the common report giuen out by him and his faction: that not onely the ſaid king catholike was priuie to the ſetting forth of that luckles labour, but alſo patronized it: as a ſpeciall worke and peece of ſeruice done on his maieſties behalf, to the greateſt preiudice that could euer haue been offered to the king catholike as well ancient as recent, and now reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>in eſſe.</hi> For firſt he makes his maieſtie the author, (in a ſort) patron, and protector of all the conſpiracies, treaſons, and treacheries that are or can be brought againſt himſelfe, or any other ſoueraigne prince built vpon the erronious principles and grounds there laid downe, by

                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:20192:172"/> the many wide open gaps, made through his popular doctrine. For all rebellious multitudes in euery prouince, court or countrie liuing vnder the Spaniſh gouernment or elſe where: to enter and claime authoritie ouer him, if in any thing they take pepper in the noſe, by leaſt concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diſlike: and all this vnder pretence of glorious ſtiles &amp; titles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths and ſtates. Then he inſinuateth as though the right &amp; title as well to the crowne of England as alſo of Fraunce (and by conſequent to the crowne and kingdome of all Europe, there being not one but his title to it, is as good if not better, then it is to England) were wholy in his highnes guift and free for him to beſtow where he pleaſeth. And out of this groſſe conceit he bringeth for an aſſured aſſertion, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of the catholike religion and king catholike together: as <hi>bellum ſacrum</hi> hath beene euer ſince made odious euen to a Chriſtian catholikes eares: and the Spaniard had in ſuſpition of all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian princes, that he aſpireth to a ſole abſolute monarchicall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſpition, whereas it is this ſaid father and his ſocietie that aime at it in very deed. Which no indifferent, valorous or wiſe man hearing of, but will thinke that all princes in chriſtendome haue iuſt cauſe to looke hereafter to their ſtand, and to haue a iealous, watchfull reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſt eye, aſwell vpon the Ieſuites, (and neuer to truſt a word they ſpeake in commendation of the Spaniard, and diſcommendation of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or nations compared with them) as alſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid kings, Queenes and Archduke, and Ducheſſe, &amp;c. When they pretend any thing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the catholike church or the Ieſuites behalfe: and by conſequent ſhall doe an act of high merite, iuſtice, prudence, and policy if they (I meane all other chriſtian princes and ſtates) expell theſe ſeditious factions, &amp; turbulent irreligious perſons out of all their territories, ſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories, regalties and dominions, that haue peſterd the Church of God with ſuch wicked doctrine as the proiect of that booke imports. As none will iudge otherwiſe of them, but as of moſt conſcienceles, careles, and bloody minded men, when they ſhall heare firſt of one booke ſet out (as <hi>Greenecote</hi> is) wherein the Author doth manifeſtly demonſtrate that no different religion (be it hereſie or whatſoeuer) ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue a lawfull heire in fee ſimple of his fathers inheritance, being but a ſubiect and a forraigner; then in princes rights &amp; titles to kingdomes, it muſt and ought to hold ſaith father <hi>Parſons</hi> in that place; bringing in ſundry examples, how that neither in England, catholikes by that name were debard of their lawfull inheritance vnder her Maieſtie ſince the change of religion here, neither the Puritanes in Scotland vnder the Queene Regent a catholike there: neither in Fraunce, Germany, or elſe where, was it euer heard of, that any were diſinherited for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſes, &amp;c. and then againe of an other (as <hi>Parſons</hi> Doleman is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Appendix, <hi>Philopater</hi> and others) that quite diſcard all

Noe not if in caſe hereafter they ſhould be catholike at the attempting of ſuch an exploit, or when they ſhould ſee there were no remedy. This laſt conceite with theſe hote ſpirited Puritanian, Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall faction is holden ſo farre wide and contrary to the former, as if the parties be not catholikes, euer at the inſtant when their fatherhoods would haue them (be you fully aſſured for no zeale of religion but of meere machiuilian policy, either thereby to exaſperate them againſt others, or others againſt them, and ſo to bring all a flote in fire and ſword, which is the onely thing they long for) they muſt be cenſured, iudged, and condemned preſently for reprobates, atheiſts, impoſtors to be conuerted, and men (be they Princes or whoſoeuer) vtterly of God forſaken.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine when princes and other men of learning, iudgement, and experience in ſuch pragmatical platformes do perſpicuouſly looke into: and withall perceiue that religion is abuſed, and Gods holy name blaſphemed (as being not his honor but their owne, vnder a maske of catholike zeale they wiſh for) they enter further into a deepe deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Phariſaicall proiects, iealouſly had of their owne naturall ſubiects and princely feare, of their royall eſtates. When they heare a man pretend (as father <hi>Parſons</hi> doth on Spaniardes behalfe) &amp; make a claime neuer heard of in any age, to another mans lands, in whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, quiet, and apparantly rightfull poſſeſſion, by lineall diſcent from the father to the ſonne for many hundred yeeres ſpace, times and ages paſt, it hauing continued: is now diuoluted to the preſent incumbent, or prince regnant from his aunceſters, whoſe ſtate, title, and regall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he hath, poſſeſſeth, and peaceably enioyeth: that ſo ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, indubitate a right ſhould now be called in queſtion, and that vpon the bare worde of a claymorous claime, exceeding al meane, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie and meaſure made by an arrant traytor, to God, his Prince, his countrey, and to all lawes of God, of nature, of nations, or of man: and generally miſliked of by all graue, diſcreete, prudent, learned, wiſe, religious, true harted catholikes, eſpecially for this his ſodaine camelion, vnexpected, vndeſerued, vngrounded, exorbitant, paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate apoſtrophall change, of a foiſted in pretend; audaciouſly preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (without buls, breue, billet, ticket, worde or warrant of any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie) to charge all men to allow, admit, ratifie and confirme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all gaineſay, controlment, or contradiction; ſuch a Soueraigne as he the ſaid father <hi>Parſons</hi> will appoint them: otherwiſe to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Atheiſtes, fooles, rebels, malicious politikes, and aduerſe to his catholike Maieſtie, and (forſooth) the common cauſe: this, this is that moſt odious, ſcandalous, irreligious, treacherous, &amp; erronious doctrine, which is ſo preiudicial to the king catholike and his pretended cauſe: as
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:20192:173"/> whiles Spaine is Spaine, England, England, Fraunce, Fraunce, and Rome, Rome, will it neuer be forgotten nor forgiuen, nor the iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thereof put out of all princes harts. So as iuſtly father <hi>Parſons</hi> may be pointed at for woorſe then a fabling libeller: and were woorthie were he not a prieſt, to be ſet vpon the pillorie, and that euen by his catholike Maieſtie; for bearing the world in hand that he was ſet on, to write thoſe libels by warrant and priuitie of the ſaid ſurmiſed preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor: whereas all circumſtances both in the ſame bookes and ſcheduls, together with thoſe plotcaſters ſpeeches in ſecret to their friendes, and the many dangers, damages, indignities &amp; diſcommodities accrewing to the king and his royal eſtate: doe argue quite contrarie. This is that venemous law, will pearce the king catholike to the very naked hart, if his Maieſtie permit it to paſſe currant without due puniſhment inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the preſumant ſcribe: and ſpeedie aboliſhment of ſo poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pragmaticall a platforme; no leſſe dangerouſly caſt, then traitorouſly laide to intrap all princes in Chriſtendome in a Templars ſnare: and as preiudiciall (if not more) in chiefe to the crowne and ſafetie of his royal perſon, to his family in <hi>eſſe,</hi> and to his ſucceſſors for euer hereafter; as to any other prince or monarch whoſoeuer. For let his Highnes winke at this doctrine and ſeeme to authorize it: and then what better war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or more plauſible can be deuiſed (when minds of people in all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as ruefull experience doth tell vs, are now a daies ſo quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated with grieuous ſores of guſtes and diſcontent eaſily corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with maladies of contention, and haſtely ſet on horſebacke with ſuperfluous humors of nouelties, innouations, ambition, diſdaine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, thirſting after bloud, deſirous of liberty, and greedily affecting ſoueraignty:) then thus to authorize all and euery Prouince vnder his gouernment to rebell againſt him at their pleaſure: and auouche, maintaine, and defend for lawfull, all their outragious inſurrections, malepert mutinies, and contagious crimes, againſt his highnes and ſoundeſt part of his nobles and ſubiects euery where, but eſpecially in the Low countries vnder this counterfeited conference holden at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam amongſt the States there.</p>
                  <p>Yea by this colourable doctrine of Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> hotch potch, prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous common wealthes authority, when it comes to reaſoning (ſtanding the premiſes without the kings controlment:) they may lawfully auerre al their practiſes, proceedings and deeds paſt: they may admit his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie peacebly to gouerne and raigne ouer them with this condition that he ſhall mantaine the courſe by them begun for gouernment, and allow of all their prophane and irreligious orders ſet downe for ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as to be let in and put out at their pleaſure. And thus vnder a cloak of a moſt ſhamfull heathniſh Turkiſh and ridiculous common wealths authority (neuer ſeene, nor heard, nor liked, nor allowed of by God or
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:20192:173"/> man) the king <hi>regnant</hi> ſhould be as the terme goeth to day a man to morrow none. Now a king crownd at twelue a clocke at noonetyde, and preſently diſinueſted of all his roabes of eſtate and vncrowned againe by prime if it ſo pleaſed the mocke maieſtie of the multitude: at the kings royall approch to the imperiall throne of regalitie, he ſhall haue the title in words of a king monarchiall with <hi>viuat rex in aeternum,</hi> but like a king of clowts ere euer he take regall ſtate vpon him, he ſhall heare a proclamation from a Democracy, with <hi>penes nos reſpublica regimen &amp; imperium:</hi> if the ſaid ſtate popular be ſtrong ynough to beare away the ſtile and title of a colorable weale publike. And thus <hi>per circulum,</hi> one king diſplaced after an other, none being ſure of his ſtate, but remoueable by law at the good will and pleaſure of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile vulgus,</hi> as mutable as the weathercocke: the Spaniſh maieſtie, and Archgrace of Auſtria (being once in poſſeſſion of the Engliſh, French, &amp; Scots crownes) muſt depend vpon the exorbitant, inconſtant, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate willes of their owne vnruly vaſſals to be expeld the next day after: if either he diſpleaſe, or an other better conceite them in their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke, rude, ruffling humours. And ſo one after an other muſt be placed, or diſplaced, as theſe common wealthes humoriſts fancy beſt. To whom (as Maſter <hi>Charles Paget</hi> hath well noted) king <hi>Philip</hi> muſt obey like a poore lacky in a French Ioupe, to runne and turne, ſit, and ſtand, raigne, and render, accept and abiure his crowne and kingdome, rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and all, as a ſubiect, ſeruant, and poore vaſſall at their appointment, and right ſerued by his owne acceptance and allowance of a Law and legifer ſo contemptible, diſgracefull, and preiudiciall to the ſacred ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of a King.</p>
                  <p>But queſtionleſſe, if either his late maieſtie, or preſent king <hi>regnant,</hi> had vnderſtood our Engliſh idiome or been truly informed of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of thoſe his worthleſſe workes, or had knowne what abſurdities, contradictions, and ſpitefull preiudices, had lien cloſe cowched betwixt the barke and tree, the roote, and the rinde, the ſuperficiall ſhew in words, and reall proceedings in acts, of father <hi>Parſons</hi> and his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates bewitching both his and our Soueraignes loyall ſubiectes (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the populars of euery Prince in Chriſtendome) with this his moſt dangerous, irreligious, wretched, and rebellious doctrine, made for his owne purpoſe, vnder a flattering diſſimulate pretence, of aduauncing his maieſties title to that he hath no right vnto: and thereby to bring both him and all other Princes in ſubiection to theſe popular ſtate conſpirators, for their owne auncient, iuſt, and lawfull inheritance: he would ſure haue reiected him with heue, and ho, in a ſtrappado: vnleſſe that his prieſthood might happely haue ſaued him at a pinch of extremitie. But yet his maieſtie may perhaps caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Inquiſition, and cauſe him to be degraded, eraced, and burnt for
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:20192:174"/> an heretike, if he obſtinately maintaine what he hath begun: but that is the ſpite of it, a Ieſuite wil ſtand to nothing, though there be a thouſand witneſſes of it) when his bookes and libels ſhall come in print for theſe matters, tranſlated into Latine or Spaniſh, with perfect annotations of that corrupt text of his, taken out of his owne, and his confederates workes againſt himſelfe, for better information of his highneſſe, and the ſacred Inquiſition of many blaſphemies, foule abuſes, and groſſe errors. As firſt affirming as erſt I told you: how that all ſucceſſion go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and gouernors or whatſoeuer is included or dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the law diuine and of nature, is all one without poſſibility of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or change: as God and nature (ſaith he) are common and one to all alike, &amp;c. He thereby couertly by a fallacy denies free will in man, putting no difference betwixt the lawes of nature generall, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall: or that lawe which is common to man, together with brute beaſtes, and that other which is proper to man alone. Which latter (as that whereupon onely this gouernment dependeth) he muſt grant to be naturally ſubiect to alteration and change, as the former is tyed to immutability and permanent continuance in one and the ſelfe ſame ſtate. Then hereupon followeth an other abſurditie <hi>ſcil.</hi> a king ſaith he in plaine termes holdeth his crowne, regality, and kingdome, by the goodwill of the common wealth his vaſſals where he raigneth. Againe, an other abſurditie or groſſer error may be this: that he affirmeth this common wealth (which he auoucheth to controle regall maieſtie in forme aboue recited to place, and diſplace, kings and ſubiectes at their pleaſure) hath to challendge this priuiledge vnto it: that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the holy Ghoſt in ſuch ſort as that in ſentence iudiciall it cannot erre. And by conſequent I inferre firſt; that he meaneth abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of a Ieſuiticall common wealth ſquared, agreeing to the high Counſell of Reformation. (For neuer could I heare any other ſtate, court, or aſſociation that they would honor ſo much as to giue out they could not erre, ſaue only themſelues and their ſociety, &amp;c.) And then againe: that this ſuppoſed of a Ieſuitical common wealth <hi>ſcil. Quod reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica non poteſt errare:</hi> it followeth that rebles &amp; traitors may hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on build what the liſt, and bring in the great Turke, or <hi>Cam,</hi> of <hi>Catay,</hi> to rule ouer vs without controlement. And this brings in an other contradiction. For whereas in one place he holdeth that titles to kingdomes of Princes once ſettled are not to be examined, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely obeyed, by priuate men: in an other place quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he preſumes vpon his owne head to examine titles of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt monarches on earth, and to determine them by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation in a publike conference of a wine tauerne authoritie. And bicauſe <hi>vno abſurdo dato plura ſequuntur:</hi> therefore to make ſhew that this conference was by authoritie not of priuate but of publike perſons:
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:20192:174"/> therefore muſt euery wayfaring man &amp; traueller, tinker &amp; pedlar, rogue and runnagate, tag and rag that is a member of father <hi>Parſons</hi> common wealth, more exorbitant then his former (called of many the Earle of <hi>Leicesters</hi> common wealth or <hi>Greencote</hi>) muſt be a publike perſon, and not daily and howerly caried away in priuate from his owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: nor yet examine the matter priuately, before or after he come to conferre thereof with this graue father, we may be ſure and the reſt of the Ieſuits appointed for that purpoſe: Iuſt like to this legifers lawe giuen to his vicegerent the Archprieſt, to cut off all meetings or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to be had amongſt ſecular prieſts about his authoritie. And a very like lawe or rather abuſe of all lawe and order, is his tyrannicall courſe taken amongſt the Engliſh ſtudents at Rome, that they may not haue their mutuall meetings, congratulations, recreations, and other ſolaces and comforts of one chamber, <hi>claſſe,</hi> and company with another, as earſt they haue had, and is euery where elſe to be found, where any humanitie, religious pietie, or charitable wiſh or deſire of either ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall welfare, or corporall health, progreſſe and practiſe of ſtudie, vertue and learning is reſident in the Rector, Principall or chiefe. But Ieſuits muſt needes ſmell of innouations and ſingularitie in all things: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how ſhould we knowe their rare indowments, illuminations, and familiar acquaintance with their maker &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And to this abſurditie a blaſphemie of his may be added, wherein he maketh this oppoſition againſt the ſacred ſtate of regall dignitie and throne triumphant of imperiall maieſtie: to wit, that the title, honor, and regall dignitie of a crowne, is of all other things ſo irregular and extraordinarie, as not onely an vſurper, diſſeizer, intruder, and impious tyrant, but alſo euen a very infidell, a traitor, a butcherly murtherer, or a moſt baſe <hi>Aſſiſmiſtial</hi> crue; if once he may attaine it by the rules of father <hi>Parſons</hi> common wealth: then his title is neuer after to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by any (except a Ieſuit, you muſt alwaies vnderſtand) but euery one is bound (as is aboue ſaid) in conſcience to obey the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Loe here noble princes and you deere catholikes, what you are to learne out of the Ieſuiticall doctrine. Certainly therein is nothing elſe but fallacie vpon fallacie, error vpon error, one contradiction encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring another, and all nothing but treacheries, treaſons and conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The ſtate of a monarchie is of all other gouernments the moſt perfect and excellent: and yet forſooth the tenure of a crowne is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, infamous, as out of all rule and order. The actuall poſſeſſion of a kingdome or ſtate at the firſt vſurpation of it, muſt onely guide the right as the moſt materiall point to lead the inheritance and ſucceſſion of a crowne which way it liketh beſt. The common wealth is the onely iudge of the poſſeſſionar or king regnant to controll him at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the people. A king was made to rule a common wealth, and a
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:20192:175"/> common wealth to obey a king: and yet carts muſt leade carthorſes, ſchollers guide ſchoolemaſters, people teach preachers, children rule parents, and an vnruly irregular diſordered, multitude witkout head, or of many heads, (none good) like a monſter, cloaked by a fallacie to abuſe ſimple people vnder the name of a common wealth, muſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the moſt irregular and extraordinarie crowne. And ſo lawes muſt be conſtrued conformable to the ſenſual appetite of a multitude: &amp; not the multitude reformed agreeable to Gods lawes. Soueraignes muſt accommodate themſelues to the manners and conditions of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, be they good or bad: and not ſubiects apply themſelues to the arbitrament of their ſoueraignes be they neuer ſo good and gracious, longer then they liſt to obey them. Soueraignes muſt raigne vpon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance onely <hi>de facto ad beneplacitum populi,</hi> in a bare poſſeſſion of a crowne: but not <hi>de iure</hi> to continue the ſame by order of lawe in his owne right, longer or otherwiſe then the varieties of humors altering the diſpoſitions in men, may mooue the people to interprete the lawe from time to time vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſhall neither the king catholike, nor the emperor, nor any other ſoueraigne haue aſſurance of ſafetie for their perſon or ſtate one minute of an hower; and all by this vnchriſtian directorie of father <hi>Parſons:</hi> which makes all their actions good and allowable to diſplace princes at their pleaſure. And yet ſtill vice muſt be vertue, violence made law, wrongs iudged rights, hangmen made iudges, and traitors crowned kings: but depoſible alwaies and actually oftentimes muſt be depoſed, be there cauſe or no cauſe; be they capable or incapable; be it in the field of warre, or in the land of peace. Bicauſe (forſooth) Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> publike ſtate or ſtatiſticall doctrine of runnagates (called here a Common wealth) doth hold it neceſſary to be ſo: &amp; is the onely iudge peramount in all ſtate caſes &amp; commiſſions for a crowne, king, &amp; kingdome without appeale to any higher iudge whoſoeuer. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euery <hi>Precopite Tartarian</hi> multitude, thus incorporated getting once the ſtile and title of a publike ſtate, in their owne opinion, may brook the name of a Geneuian, or an Heluetian, or a Switherly commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth: and alter, chaunge, and innouate the courſe of inheritance and ſucceſſion, not onely to crownes and kingdomes, but alſo to euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons heritage holden in Fee ſimple. So as they may beare away the right and true title caſt vpon any from the king to the Freeholder by the lawes of Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> new common wealth; and giue it to whom they liſt though the party be neither member of that ſtate, nor ſubiect thereunto by nature, ſubmiſſion, infranchiſment or other ordinary and lawfull meanes. For if the onely lawful and good tenure of a kingdome, diademe, and crowne be holden by the king himſelfe of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will onely of the common wealth, that is as much to ſay as a Tenant at
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:20192:175"/> will of the people: then followeth it by this hyperbolical fiction againſt the ſtate of inheritance in regall maieſtie, that <hi>à fortiori,</hi> all a ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes ſubiects alſo which haue any lands of ancient demaine or other inheritance muſt be ſubiect to the like lawes. And ſo by good or at leaſt neceſſary ſequell is inferd, that this they doe to confront the king of Spaine in chiefe points of regal ſtate: and to harden the Hollanders, Zelanders and others, there to mantaine warres in open action againſt him: as alſo to miniſter new matter of rebellion in Arragon, in Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and in all other of his owne dominions, for a ſeditious route to thruſt him quite out of his whole monarchiall eſtate of Spaine, and to depriue him of kingdome, crowne, and life at their pleaſure. To all this Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> hath prepared a ready way to ſerue his owne turne and his ſocieties, not the king nor any of his royall iſſues therewith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to the Spaniards (much more to any other) kingdome, being onely by his common wealth and popular applauſes neuer ſo well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled: yet holding his crowne but as Tenant at will of the ſaid common wealth, who may reuoke their admittance when they liſt to quarrell: it followeth that he hath no eſtate of, nor aſſurance at all in him, for any thing he holdeth.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath this great Statiſt diſcouered at vnawares his owne, and his confederates ambitious aſpires, treacherous intent, Atheall expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, pragmaticall practiſe, and Matchiuilian platforme to make the world beleeue he pleads onely for the Spaniards, and that ſimply and plainely for religions ſake: when his drift directly is (immediately by meanes of conqueſt intended for England) to bring all Chriſtendome into an vprore for common ſoldiers to examine their ſoueraignes what title they hold by: and thereupon themſelues by craft, mony, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes gathered together through their Atheall policy, bring Spaine and all the reſt vnder their ſubiection. Which apparant intendment plots and practiſes with other like waighty conſiderations, if the late king had liued: would haue beene a ſufficient warning to him for euer, being abuſed by any Ieſuite againe. And happily when this king reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and his ſiſter the Lady <hi>Infanta</hi> ſhall know thus much, and much more then here is ſaid: it will breede the ſame effect in their princely heads, as a fit meane to cut off theſe turbulent ſtate tamperers, and no leſſe ambitious aſpirers, then vngratefull maligners of thoſe princes, that haue backt, aduaunced, and defended them moſt. And either here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after force them in Spaine and in all other countries to auoide princes courts, and medlings with nobles or the ſtate where they liue: and ſo retire themſelues to their cloyſters as religious men ſhould do, and as all do but they only who deſpiſe all order; or elſe ſet them packing out of this Chriſtian world amongſt the Antipodes, Indians, &amp; other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to vs here vnknowen. For ſo long as they ſtay vncontrold as they

For that the generall iealouſie which moſt of that ſacred conſiſtory haue of the Ieſuits pride, ambition, &amp; greedy affectation of a ſupremacy: hath been cauſe that of late (as ſome do ſay) there is an order taken that no Ieſuits ſhal euer be admitted hereafter to be Card at leaſt not in that authority as ſome of them haue bene in, leaſt they worke ſome crafty meanes to get to that worthy dignitie as in tract of time they may bring it about to haue him Pope by that meanes: and then queſtionleſſe haue at all Chriſtendome for bothe ſtates eccleſiaſticall and temporall. Which to make apparant, that they aime at no leſſe (and by conſequent that, as there was but one onely Ieſus who was high prieſt and king in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes Monarchiall Empire or kingdome of the Iewes with his twelue Apoſtles and the reſt of his diſciples ſubſtituted vnder him: ſo in their intended platforme but one Ieſuite Pope and prince Monarchiall (like a <hi>preſbyter Iohn</hi>) in the kingdome &amp; monarchie of the whole Chriſtian world, with the fathers and lay brothers of his ſocietie ſubſtituted in euery country, region and prouince vnder him. Although by relection of what hath bene already ſaid there may ynough be gathered ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to confirme and demonſtrate it againſt them: eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our Engliſh Ieſuiticall practiſes and proceedings, with others of other nations: yet in my opinion there is no one thing that diſcouers their ambitious aſpire more herein, then father <hi>Parſons Doleman</hi> in his peremptorie cenſure of all impugners of his Ieſuiticall or popular title (for call it no more his Spaniſh title hereafter, ſeeing he fiſheth wholy for his owne ſocietie, in as high preiudice to the Spaniards Maieſtie as to any other) to the Engliſh crowne.

Thus then, he (I meane father <hi>Parſons</hi>) teacheth in his ſaid booke of titles and other manuſcripts: Firſt, that all men liuing vnder the Spaniſh allegiance are bound to take notice of their kings rightfull title, intereſt and claime to the Engliſh crowne &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the Engliſh our countrymen, though of another nation and no way ſubiect to Spaine at any time ſince the world began, were obliged to acknowledge and ſubſcribe (and as ſome haue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs, to ſweare) vnto the rightfull ſucceſſion of the Lady <hi>Infanta.</hi>

                  <p>This groſſe error of father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and his no leſſe great abſurditie then raſh, fooliſh, preſumptuous, and moſt dangerous courſe, where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his proiects do tend by this his pretence for the Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour his owne and his ſocieties traitorous aſpires: doe argue his inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and pride to be, ſo great as they blind his iudgement, ſence and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from diſcerning that theſe his plots, drifts and deuiſes, will be not onely condemned and laughed at by a generall applauſe; but he alſo vtterly reiected and caſt off, out of all indifferent mens conceites (be they of what religion ſoeuer) that beare any loue to their countrie: or that wiſh a preſeruation of their auncient nobility and gentry, freed by lawes, cuſtomes, and priuiledges from that tyrannie &amp; ſpoile which this hard natured and moſt cruell harted man ſeemeth moſt to deſire for his owne priuate reſpects and commodities.</p>

For conſidering that he intends to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and chaunge all lawes, cuſtoms and orders (which make me often remember ſome mens ſtrange conceits, that he ſhould either beget, or immediately procure Antichriſt) it cannot be; but that the popularity he now ſo greatly in couert wiſe commendeth, will breake out vpon one occaſion or other (ere euer he be ſettled or well warmed in his kingdome) into ſome open rebellion againſt him, otherwiſe ſhould ſuch a rable looſe the name of <hi>Mobile vulgus.</hi> And further admit that his prouidence, fore caſt and foreſight were ſuch, as euen in the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the Ieſuiticall ſtate, there ſhould be ſuch gouernors (as lay bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ſocietie) appointed at the ſacke of euery city, winning of euery hold, fort or ſluce, and conqueſt of euery kingdome, countrey or prouince, as by their marſhiall prowes combinde with ciuill policie might keepe them all in order ſubordinately one vnder another: and all vnder their Generall-Pope-monarchiall-ſole Emperor ouer the whole world: yet conſidering the extreme ambition of that kinde of people, as before hath beene paſſantly touched here and there (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially noted in the brabling contentions betwixt the two great empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> and Fa. <hi>Heywood</hi>) this order whatſoeuer it ſhall be, or how orderly ſoeuer obſerued for the whole, vntil they haue gotten that into their hands, they all do gape after. No queſtion but it will breake off in ſhort time, and that they ſhall be forced to alter, chaunge, and make new lawes againe. And this being fitly agreeing to a principle of their owne, ſet downe by M. <hi>Paget</hi> as he hath obſerued in them, <hi>ſcil. Omnia pro tempore, nihil pro veritate:</hi> no queſtion of it, but their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be as vncertaine as their new conceited monarchie, their monarchie as mutable as their raigne, and their raigne as variable as the weathercocke in the winde: or <hi>Protheus</hi> in his Complements: or the ſea <hi>Euripus</hi> in his croſſe tyde ebbes and flowes, who for his in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy hath not of olde beene holden for more infamous then Fa. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> for the like offence is iuſtly iudged and accounted as moſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous in our daies.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwere directy to the Article propoſed, no queſtion is to be made of it, but that the gouernment they do directly intend at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is a moſt abſolute ſoueraigntie, dominion and ſtate cleerely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from ſubordination to any lawe or legifer diuine or humane:
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:20192:179"/> and therefore it is rightly called <hi>Deſpoticon</hi> in the higheſt degree of exemption, immunitie, imperialtie, and abſolute raigne, rule, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as containing in it all three ſorts of gouernment, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall, Ariſtocraticall, Democraticall in matters of counſell and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of common wealths cauſes, but not in points of regaltie, honor, &amp; inheritance. For there ſhal be neither title, nor name, nor honor giuen taken or done to any Prince, Duke, Marqueſſe, Earle, Vicount, Lord, Baron, or the like (all the Ieſuiticall gouernors being puritan like, ſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, elders, prouincials, rectors, miniſters, &amp;c.) neither ſhall there be any ſucceſſion by birth or blood, to any honor office or magiſtracy from the monarch <hi>Pater</hi> Generall to the <hi>minor Pater</hi> miniſter, but all ſhall goe by election and choice: neither ſhall any title, clayme or right of inheritance be made, chalenged, pretended, intended or diuolued from the father to to ſonne: but all ſhall reſt in this <hi>Presbyter Iohn</hi> or Pope-Monarchiall-Generals gift. No noble, knight, Eſquier, or ſwayne poſſeſſing more then the monarch ſhall beſtow vpon him, as tenant at will for the time, nor for terme of life, iuſt like to the Turkes diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lands and honors. And if any thinke that this is but a ſurmiſe, let them reperuſe what here paſſantly is written in theſe <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> and confer (if poſſibly they can get them) Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> bookes of titles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his high counſell of Reformation, and other paſſages in manuſcripts, and then doubtleſſe they will be of my minde.</p>

Mary yet if you aske other men diſpaſſionate, vnpartiall and not ſpeaking of affection, by what law or authoritie they doe attempt and teach theſe things; they will tell you, they haue neither law diuine nor humane ſo to doe, but a law irregular made by an exlegall legifer father <hi>Parſons</hi> by name, who hath preiudiced, iniuried, and wronged by his infamous libels, all lawes and lawyers cuſtomes, ſtates and orders. For firſt he hath preiudiced the lawes, common, pontifical, of nations, of nature, &amp; of God himſelfe: as in the premiſſes of ſundry precedent <hi>Quodlibets</hi> may appeere. Then he hath preiudiced the lawes municipiall of this noble Iſle, laboring to foiſt in, to outward ſhew the lawes ciuill Romane, of <hi>Caeſar</hi> aboliſhed aboue a thouſand yeeres agoe, by authoritie of the See apoſtolike at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſute of king <hi>Lucius</hi> with the general conſent of all his noble Lords, the woorthy Britaines then peeres of theſe two realmes. He hath abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the law, cuſtome, and order obſerued in humanitie, in fawning vpon the Auſtrian line, vnder pretence to bring in the imperiall lawes of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> into this land: but intending in very deede to thruſt a law vpon vs neuer heard of before throughout the vniuerſall world, nor I think euer ſhall be put in execution vntill the comming of Antichriſt, that all run vpon wheeles with alteration and change. He hath preiudiced the lawe of propertie in inſtituting gouernment, gouernors, and hereditarie princes to be <hi>ad beneplacitum populi,</hi> and all other priuate poſſeſſiants <hi>ad beneplacitum ſuum.</hi> He hath preiudiced the lawes ciuill and imperiall of <hi>Caeſar</hi> bringing them in falſly alleged; and one thing for another as a comment for a corps, a code for a digeſt, a gloſſe for a text, a memoriall for a principle, and a note of ſome allegation vpon a ſute paſt on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of a client, for a <hi>maxime</hi> in the lawes, either vnauthentically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, or remaining litigious, pliable to any opinion, or elſe interpreted

Which violent intruſion of <hi>Caeſars</hi> lawes thus abuſed and bolſterd out, to the vtter ruine of many noble families irreuocably: he hath no ſhift to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and get it allowed of, but to delude ſimple people, to confirme it by ſundry examples of banckrupt common wealths or rather diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red multitudes. He hath abuſed and preiudiced all ſtates, common wealths, nobles and gentiles, of this and all other Chriſtian nations, by a temporized popularitie, thruſt in vpon them: accomodating himſelfe (as he ſaith) to the conditions, manners, and minds of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which euer do delight in noueltie and change. Otherwiſe (as he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly noted) had the Ieſuites neuer bene ſo admired at, in England as they are at this day.

               <p>Secondly, the moſt I doe wonder at in theſe ſtrange conceits of you (deare catholikes) is your ſimplicitie and extreame folly (pardon me for God ſake if I ſpeake home, for deepe is the wound that pearceth to the hart, and dead is the ſtroke that cuts life and ſoule a ſunder) in that you thinke it a hinderance to our cauſe, to haue ſuch bookes ſet out

For if you were of iudgement and diſcourſe, you would not but conceiue and ſee what here I meane (God willing, and if in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it be poſſible) to driue into your heads, to wit that the chiefe and originall cauſe and occaſion giuen of temptation on our part, to the Ieſuits hath beene our ſerupulous remiſſnes, childiſh nicenes, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike tendernes in ſpeaking, writing or vttering of our griefes and wrongs put vp at the Ieſuits hands, which made them ſo bold to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and peremptory to control: ſo that accounting of vs all to be but ſilly bodies and ſorie fellowes of no talent, gift or ability, like Storkiſh kings they came vpon vs poore frogs with minaces of death to him that firſt ſhould leape out of the puddle from vnder their tyranny.

But be you fully aſſured, when we are all dead and gone, theſe bookes will worke good in your poſterity to the extirpation of al Ieſuitiſme &amp; puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſmout of England for euer, they are ſo throughly diſcouered therin.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, admit all were true that their brokers haue ſet a broache con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that booke and thoſe matters: and that it were ſuch odious ſtuff as they would beare you in hand: yet will you be ſo ſimple (deere catholikes) as to beleeue them in this, that they haue gotten any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage thereby againſt vs, or that they laugh in their ſleeue to ſee vs at varience amongſt our ſelues about it (as they ſay, but falſly as ſhalbe ſhewed anone.) For what aduantage ſhall they get by it when they are detected for ſeditious, turbulent, factious perſons, ambitious aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers &amp; traitors: &amp; the ſecular &amp; ſeminary prieſts cleered of their conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies? Wil this bring good men to be hated to haue irreligious perſons made knowne: or if they ſay the word, will all others run riot with them and ſo to hell for company? No, no (deere catholikes) I wil tel you what the miſtery &amp; meaning is of al that blazon. Nothing doth more torment an enuious man then to haue others liue &amp; proſper by him. And ſo when
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:20192:183"/> the Ieſuites ſaw that the prieſts found more fauour at the ciuill magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates hands, then they could find, bicauſe they had cleered themſelues of all ſtate meddles which the Ieſuites to death can not doe: then enuy burſt out as all the world may ſee it in them.

As for example if you would haue any thing done or ſaid by your enemy for your aduantage: then put on a cowardly face of feare leaſt ſuch a thing ſhould happen, &amp; that ſeeming kind of trembling &amp; vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes ſhewed in you, wil make him more eager in deſpite to proſecute it. But if you feare ſuch words, writings or other acts indeed: and that it be ſo as poſſibly you cannot ſtop nor hinder it: then laugh at it, make it ſeeme odious or ridiculous: and in diſgrace of the actor or author, ſeeme to make ſmall or no account of it: and retort it, if it be poſſible by hooke or crooke, vpon your aduerſary: or at leaſt band it out with outward ſhew of aduantage on your part againſt him, to as many as you can come or ſend vnto: and eſpecially thoſe ſuch as are or may be thought to ſide on his ſide againſt you. And this is iuſt the Ieſuits crafty drift, and your ignorance in not ſeeing into their policy. For whether any thing make for vs or not, it is not the queſtion: but would they trowe you be ſo carefull and diligent by their neuters to haue vs know before hand, how mightily we are diſaduantaged by our writings if it were ſo?

               <p>Sixtly, you (deere Catholikes) by this your childiſh compaſſion and womanlike lenitie goe againſt the principles, grounds and rules of all arts, ſciences, lawes, cuſtomes, and orders: you goe againſt that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>maxime</hi> in the lawes, which is that, <hi>fiat iustitia &amp; ruant coeli.</hi> For wherein (deere Catholikes) ſhould iuſtice take place in the caſe propoſed, if we keepe ſilence in concealing the Ieſuits great impiety, together with their and the reſt of the Spaniſh faction (their fautors and followers) vniuſt calumniation, irreligious abuſes, and high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of prieſts and all eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction and ſtate, together with their vnnatural attempts, practiſes, and confederacies againſt our Prince and countrey, and vs all that are not of their faction. You goe againſt all cuſtome and order. For what is more innouate prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and beyond all gods forbid, then this new fanglenes in you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a company of Ieſuits (whoſe ſociety began but yeſterday in reſpect of many other religious orders) not onely before all other monaſticall perſons, but alſo euen before all ſecular prieſts and the ſtate eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, whereupon they, and all others doe and muſt depend in ſoule points: and not onely ſo, but you foreſtall vs in iudgement, you condemne vs, you iuſtifie them, you take vpon you to be para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount

And this (deer catholikes) is out of all order, farre from all ancient catholike cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, voide of all reaſon, conſcience or religion in you, running head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vpon your ruines through your ſimplicitie, wilfulnes and follie. You goe againſt the diuine rules and principles of charitie, wherein <hi>per legem Talionis oculus pro oculo,</hi> an eie for an eie, a tooth for a tooth, a tongue for a tongue, a hand for an hand is giuen on the one ſide to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend (for you know <hi>vim vi repellere licet</hi>) and on the other to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. To perſwad a Ieſuit to make ſatisfaction were as hard a matter, as to wreeſt the club out of <hi>Hercules</hi> fiſt; to wring water out of a flint, or to drinke vp the Thames at a hauſt. To put them to ſilence by our ſilence, it were a thing impoſſible: for the more ſilent we were, the more fiercely (like falſe harted cowards) they inſulted ouer vs. To liue diſgraced, defamed, and contemned for atheiſts, apoſtataes and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates as they accounted vs, was a crueller death then to haue beene torne in peeces and eaten vp aliue amongſt <hi>Anthropophagies.</hi> What ſhould we doe then? To eſcape their tongue torments (yea and hand tortures) we could not: and yet againe common charitie commands vs, our legifer preached it, his apoſtle affirmed it, that he who is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of his good name is woorſe then an infidell: and careleſſe ſhould we be, as hitherto we haue beene (as too too ſcrupulous in theſe points, God forgiue vs for it) if we ſhould ſtill ſleepe with a broken head, with a wounded hart, with a mangled conſcience torne in peeces by them, and neuer ſeeke redreſſe, nor for amends at their hands.

And this (deere catholikes) was another groſſe error in the vndiſcreet zeale of your deuout follie, quite contrary to the rules and precept of charitie: which I greatly woonder at, in that you ſeeing vs condemned, contemned and reiected for the vileſt creatures on earth: our companie and preſence ſhunned and auoyded: our ſpeech, names, and perſons holden for moſt odious: our ſacrifices, ſacraments and poore deuotions accounted of as ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, prophane and damnable: damnable (oh damnable) not onely in ſecular prieſts to offer any, but alſo in the laitie to come at any offered by vs: our deere brethren reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d prieſts, your true ancient catholike, louing ghoſtly fathers, readie to ſhed their beſt blood for your ſoules

If you thinke we haue iuſt cauſe to ſpeake and write in our owne defence, but yet not in detecting them: then tell me which way the one can be without the other, and I will crie <hi>peccaui.</hi> If you admit it neceſſarie to haue them detected and made knowne, but yet not in ſuch bitter termes: then tell me what termes (deere catholikes) doe I vſe not agreeing to their deſerts, yea or halfe ſo bitter or exorbitant as theirs are againſt the innocent? Doe I call them apoſtataes, or heretikes, or ſchiſmatikes, or ſouthſaiers, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, with many ſuch like, as odious to the eare, though none more deteſtable to the ſoule poſſeſſed with them, which they not onely haue impoſed vpon vs, but alſo made you (deere catholikes) vnder that pretence to refuſe, to deſpiſe, to deteſt vs for ſuch. But what doe I call them? Mary I call them ſeditious, bicauſe no companie, nor ſocietie, nor order in any of the three ſtates eccleſiaſticall, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or monaſticall can liue quiet by them: I call them factious, bicauſe they band out all their doings by making of parties, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of companies to ſide with them, threatening of oppoſites, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing of great matters to their fautors and followers: and ſetting all in an vprore with iealouſie, ſuſpition, and backbiting one an other: I call them traitors, bicauſe of their many conſpiracies, attempts, and practiſes againſt Pope, Prince, Church, common wealth, ſtate and all: I call them by many ſuch like names, but yet by none ſaue onely ſuch as beſt doe ſymbolize with their qualities and lewde deuiſes.

Therefore is there no way in the world left to encounter them with aduantage, but to retort and returne all backe vpon them to their ſhame and confuſion. If you aske of the Mathematician, how to paſſe betwixt two periods, he will tell you that <hi>ab extremo ad extremum non tranſitur niſi per medium.</hi> Now that the Ieſuits &amp; we are in extremes, they too lofty, and we too lowly? thty to ambitious, and we to ſubmiſſiue: they to ſtirring, and we to quiet: they too ſeditious, and we too peaceable: they too clamorous, &amp; we too ſilent, &amp;c. it is manifeſt by demonſtration in it ſelfe: yet bicauſe many can not, and moſt will not ſee into it, therefore is it of neceſſitie, that the way, meanes, and occaſions of the one and the other, ſhould be ſet forth to the viewe of the ignorant multitude, that are led away through miſconceite into error. If you aske of the Philoſopher, or Naturian, how to make the very quinteſſence and naturall qualitie of any thing beſt made knowne: he will ſay that <hi>contraria iuxta ſe poſita magis eluceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt.</hi> Now what can be more contrary then the Ieſuits, &amp; ſecular prieſts proceedings, therefore by conſequent, there is no other courſe to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for clearing of the innocents, then to haue both their dealings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and purpoſes made knowne in oppoſition ſet one againſt the other, as in theſe bookes they are at large. If you aske a Phiſition how to cure a deſperat diſeaſe, Doctor <hi>Atſlewe,</hi> if he were a liue, would giue you a deſperate, yet a ſound anſwere, but any and all agree in this, that as <hi>Calida frigidis, humida ſiccis: ſic contraria contrarijs curantur:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the more dangerous the diſeaſe is, the more deſperare is the cure: ſharp coraſiues are to be vſed, and few or no lenitiues will ſerue for the purpoſe.

Patience deere Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, for I am angry at the diuell, and malice; which two haue ſo mightily poſſeſſed your harts with error, as I know not with whom firſt to chide, whether with them in ſuggeſting, or with you in conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They ſay (and many of you deere Catholikes confirme it in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeech) that I haue written againſt the Pope his holines, and in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of the See Apoſtolike, becauſe I affirme that the bulles and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications paſt againſt her Maieſtie were wrongfully procured, and therefore of no validity: and againe for that I ſay, that if the Popes holines ſhould charge vs to obey the Archprieſt and the Ieſuits, yet we would not yeeld to it.

For whereſoeuer I talke of the non validity of bulles, &amp;c. or the wrong done to her Maieſtie in procuring of them.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:20192:186"/> pretence was wholy, merely and abſolutely for reſtoring of religion: and yet both by bookes, words and actions it hath and doth proue to the contrary, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that he pretends a conqueſt of the land, if by <hi>Parſons</hi> proiects he cannot otherwiſe haue it by compremiſe and compoſition giuen him.

               <p>They ſay I vſe certaine rowling phraſes and Rhetoricall wordes which ſmell of hereſie as in affectation of ſpeech by often repetition of one thing (vz. <hi>Diſobedient we are, &amp;c. and neuer ſhall &amp;c.</hi>) &amp; theſe words, <hi>Romiſh, Ieſuiticall, and the deuill, &amp;c.</hi> To which I anſwere (as to the laſt firſt) that if ſome words be placed or printed amiſſe as Romiſh for Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, alas for pure neede what beggerly quarrelling obiections are theſe: but yet to make a direct reſponſe (deare catholikes) I was not preſent at the printing to be a corrector: nor had I the ſight of one proofe vntill the whole booke was out in print, and ſold, and then too late to ſet downe <hi>errata</hi> which in that word <hi>Romiſh</hi> and in ſundry others I found. A reaſon whereof aſwell to confirme my ſound conceite, as alſo to excuſe the Printer in ſome ſort may be this, that where I had written <hi>Romane</hi> out at length there they printed ſo, which you may find both in the beginning and ending of the Epiſtle, and thereby iudge of me aright: and where they found I had written ſhort <hi>(Rom.)</hi> there they printing it out at length added <hi>iſhe,</hi> and ſo made it <hi>Romiſh,</hi> thinking it to be ſo as <hi>Engliſh, Scottiſh, Iriſh, Flemiſh, &amp;c.</hi> To the next to wit <hi>Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> I cannot maruael though they cauil about it: for ſome 3. yeeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone I remember a reuerend, graue, and vertuous prieſt, yea, and as ſound, reſolute, and conſtant a catholike as the pureſt Ieſuite among them all (that I goe no further) hauing written a very learned, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and prieſtlike apology or reioynder to the Ieſuiticall calumniation about the Archprieſt: and other matters bicauſe he vſed this word <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite</hi> very often, &amp; did not (forſooth) call euery puny or nouice of theirs by the name of a <hi>father of the ſocietie,</hi> or breefly <hi>the fathers</hi> therefore was he cenſured then to ſmell of hereſie: and onely for that word and none other.

               <p>Well now to the firſt part of this obiection concerning my Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call phraſes and often repetition of words: I ſay that if the ſtile, tenure and method ſeeme too too affectate; do you (deere catholikes) me that fauour as to impute that fault (if it be one) to natures gifts not to ſmell of hereſies, I euer deteſting the latter as much as who can deteſt it moſt, yea euen from my cradle or time of knowing ſinne, hauing an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſire by Gods ſpeciall grace and fauour (though wretched and ſinfull I, did not proſecute thoſe ſweete motions ſo ſpeedilie as I ſhould, but fell from my faith (receiued by baptiſme) my maker and redeemer: vntill it pleaſed him <hi>Secundum multitudinem miſerationum ſuarum</hi> to looke back vpon a poore ſeruant of his owne, his bleſſed mothers, and <hi>Peters:</hi> and to call me home againe) to be a catholike, &amp;c. And no way embracing the former of any nice affectation or premeditate intent of fluent eloquence or ſetled ſtudie, how to be finicall in my ſpeeche, or ſeeking for inuention of exquiſite phraſes, or vſing the art or helpe of any Rhetoricall figure (all which yet in ſome ſenſe might be tollerable, lawfull and commendable without all ſuſpition of hereſie) but euen as in preaching ſo in writing as God and nature hath giuen me a litle meane, memory and poore and plaine facilitie in ſpeeche for deliuerie of my minde: ſo naturallie ſuch paſſages doe paſſe from me by inward motion (not affectation) <hi>ex abundantia cordis</hi> writing as faſt as my hand can trot <hi>quicquid in bucca venit;</hi> and neuer to this hower could I haue the patience to pen ſermon or prick out a pamphlet otherwiſe then (after I had laid my wits together for a three howers or a daies ſpace at moſt, I had contriued the matter in my head; neuer writing any one thing twice ouer to this preſent: as witneſſes enough I haue of all theſe books and writings (ſo many of them as are done by me either in part or in all). Which I ſpeake not for my owne praiſe: for that no doubt through want of reuiſing and peruſing of my writings many things are amiſſe, or not ſo well as otherwiſe they might be if patience, ſpace and place would permit me: But that which moues me thus to write is this ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of affectation and by conſequent the ſmell of an hereticall ſpirite, bothe which as I doe deteſt to death, ſo hope I this may ſuffice as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimonie to abate (if not aboliſh) and take away all ſuch raſh, if not malitious iealouſies had of me for the ſame.</p>
               <p>They ſay further that not onely I, but the reſt of our company that are oppoſite againſt them, are greatly to be ſuſpected that wee ſmell of hereſie by reaſon that we neuer writ of theſe things before we ſawe our ſelues in danger of the halter, and were become very inward (for bad offices) with ſome in ſpeciall authoritie vnder her Maieſtie. Which to confirme and make ſeeme more probable, they incenſe you (deere Catholikes) againſt vs to keepe you in; that you ſlide not, nor winde your ſelues out from them: they alledge firſt the extraordinary fauours

And laſt of all they alledge the open ſermons which haue beene made againſt vs at Paules croſſe and other places, condemning vs to be as dangerous to the preſent ſtate and common wealth, as the Ieſuites are, &amp; that which we write is but for a colour to ſaue our ſelues, &amp;c. To all which falſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes I anſwere in as breefe a manner as ſuch groundleſſe forgeries doe require.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then it is moſt falſe that any one hath written of theſe matters, for riddance of themſelues out of danger from vnder our aduerſaries hands: Nay it is well knowne, that all thoſe who haue written, were freeſt from danger, and furtheſt off from all likelihood or probability of troubles, or incombrance of any whoſoeuer that liued in England, or out of it of our afflicted condition of life, and frownd of ſtate: as by articulating the particulers is apparant. And for my ſelfe in ſpeciall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ynough I haue of it, that theſe ſixteene yeeres ſpace was I neuer (to ſpeake morally) in leſſe danger nor more ſecuritie of keeping out of our common aduerſaries hands then I was at what time I firſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any token of extraordinary fauour. Nay letters are yet extant to be ſeene, which ſhew that I ſtood ſo much vpon mine owne innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to hazard my apprehenſion, as knowing aſſuredly that (my function and profeſſion, prieſthood, and religion ſet aſide) no creature liuing could touch me with the leaſt diſloyall act, word, or thought: I reſted indifferent whether I were taken or not, had not other motiues byaſde my will to acceptance of ſuch honorable fauours as then were offered, and ſince I haue found which were and are lawfull, honeſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, as well in the <hi>donor</hi> as the <hi>donee.</hi> And yet not to giue any Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite account of the one or the other. But leauing them and their <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanean</hi> fautors in their guilty iealouſies had of innocents. to be in their owne predicament of corruption; I ſay now more, that before euer

Which writings being afterwards taken in others of my brethrens cuſtody to whom I had ſent them, make the caſe as cleare as day light at noone tide, that this is no new conceite had of the Ieſuits, by any of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and by my ſelfe leaſt of all: neither done, nor ſet in hand withall; nor yet intended of any mind, or the leaſt thought of preuenting our owne dangers (being in none at all) or yet of purpoſe to come in fauor with the ciuill magiſtrate by this meanes; the Ieſuits and their faction, being the firſt brothers thereof; and it hauing beene our conceite from the beginning, that their courſe was naught: and therefore our direct intent <hi>ab initio</hi> to ſtop the impotent violence of their heady attempts, and vnnaturall practiſes ſo much as we could poſſibly. And the onely fault and offence (if any were) which we committed therein, was our too too long ſilence, often writing, often ſpeaking, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> intreating from time to time (but were reiected of that proud, inſolent, factious compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; of you (deare catholikes) ſeduced by them) for peace, quiet, and vnity with the Ieſuites; and to haue a ſurceaſe from all ſtate medles, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellings, or other proceedings, that might exaſperate the ſtate againſt vs, and you (deare catholikes) that now ſo hotely are bent on the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites behalfe, as in recompence of our good wils and tender care had ouer you, you are ready to fly in our faces, and requite vs with all infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, diſdainfull, and reprochfull ſpeeches.

To the third obiection of our common aduerſaries diſgracefull ſpeeches giuen out againſt vs more then againſt the Ieſuits, it is a ſenſeleſſe forgerie, and ſmels of a Ieſuiticall ſpirit, whoſe <hi>Luciferian</hi> pride is ſuch as it delighteth to be counted famous in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, extraordinary in ſuffering of torments, and to haue none to equall him in impietie, but all baſe and meanely eſteemed of, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with himſelfe in villanie. Which proude conceit ſeeing the Ieſuits haue it, much good or miſchiefe (whether they more delight in) may it doe them. I will promiſe them we will neuer compare with them, mary to ſay that any honorable perſon ſhould haue vs in contempt and them in grace and fauor for our oppoſite courſes taken, that is as far from ſenſe to thinke it, as neere to ſottiſhnes to beleeue it, vnles they could make vs beleeue that all the ſtate, or thoſe honors they meane of, are throughly <hi>ſpanified</hi> and entred into a trayterous league &amp; confederacie againſt their Prince and countrey. And the like anſwere may ſerue to the fourth obiection of making one of vs cut one an others throte, &amp;c. which are childiſh arguments, and but bugges, bulbeggers, or hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, fit to feare babies withall (as theſe patches by their cogging, foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and deuiſes, make you all (deare catholikes) none other, and yet you will not ſee into it. For what can the councell, or ſtate, get out of vs more then is in our harts, and inward intents, and meanings; and what is inwardly in vs, which outwardly we doe not profeſſe and make knowne to all the world? to wit, a catholike reſolue for our Romane faith, church, and religion: an Engliſh reſolution for our natiue Prince, ſtate, and countrey: and a reſolute intent (euer God before aſſiſting vs with his grace) in well, and in woe, to remaine conſtant, loyall, ſeruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and faithfull to both to death. And more then this, neither Angell, man, woman, nor deuill, can get out of vs, bicauſe more then this we haue not in vs: and if this will cut our throts, or make one of vs vndoe an other, or vrge the ſtate againſt vs, or cauſe vs to be euil thought of, and in the end cut off, when they (the ſaid ſtate) haue gotten out of vs what may ſteed them, and the like <hi>vos iudicate.</hi> Of this I am ſure we ſhall dye for religion, and not for treaſon, and this is alſo morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the ſtate will neuer in policie (if we would like Ieſuites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite them full of all impietie) ſeeke the ſecular prieſts deſtruction, who labour wholy for the preſeruation of our Countrey, and in excuſe of their law made (ſo farre as is poſſible to excuſe them) againſt vs all in generall, for ſome priuate perſons offences: and on the other ſide leaue them ſcotfree, whom they know for profeſſed enimies againſt them, and all the world ſeeth how vnnaturally they haue ſought the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

This alſo is probable that (if the Ieſuites haue ſo many great perſons in Court of the Spaniſh faction, and their fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as they make boaſt of) they may vnder hand preuaile ſo farre as to get vs all cut off together with them, without daigning vs any notice to be taken of our loyalty more then theirs; but if ſuch an extremitie ſhould happen (as queſtionleſſe no one thing that craft of deuill, or wit of man, or waight of <hi>Mammon</hi> can afford, ſhall be left vntried to effect it) yet, what then? ſhal we for that, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to the deſolation of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and vtter extripation of all your (deare catholikes) poſterity, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reuenge our ſelues of ſo inhumane cruelty, and extreme wrong of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vs? no certainely, we will all rather dye in miſerie, one after an other: and leaue our innocent blood, to crie for vengeance to him who both can and will take vengeance on thoſe ſhould ſo afflict vs, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they doe our intent and harmeles harts.

               <p>You know (deere catholikes) that zeale, charitie, and loue diuine,<note place="margin">Loue, properly reſpecteth man, charity the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and zeale God himſelfe: as their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, principal, and proper obiect.</note> are three words of a different ſignification, in regard of their obiects: &amp; yet may be, &amp; often are all one, in reſpect of the ſubiect wherein they are inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: as al three, being poprer acts of the wil, are inſerted in man, by the benefit of creation: ſo are they perfected by grace diuine, in the worke of our redemption, by application of the merites of Chriſt vnto vs, in the ſacraments of his church, as in the veſſells of our ſaluation. And this difference of affections, or diſtinction betwixt loue, charitie, and zeale, is to be found here, and there, in ſundrie parts of Scripture; as well by the words, as actions, and practiſe of our Sauiour, and his ſeruants here on earth. As when our mercifull redeemer would ſound his ſeruant, &amp; ſucceſſor S. <hi>Peter,</hi> his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s towards him, as he was man: <hi>amor &amp; dilectio</hi> (both loue in Engliſh) were the words moſt, &amp; all who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in requeſt: as <hi>Simon Ioannes amas me, &amp; diligis me plus his,</hi> &amp;c. Againe when he ſpake in the perſon of his ſweete ſpouſe; and what affection thoſe had or ought to haue that labour on her behalfe, &amp; in his name to reconcile ſoules, and bring all into his fold, that they might be made all <hi>vnum ouile &amp; vnus pastor</hi> then <hi>charitas</hi> (charitie) was the word of that worth, as none could be worthier: and thereupon he ſaid that <hi>maiorem charitatem nemo habet quam vt animam ſuam ponat quis pro amicis ſuis,</hi> &amp;c. But when it came to an act, wherein Gods honour (as God) was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie, immediatelie, and abſolutelie to be reſpected: and the honour of his ſpouſe, and ſacred humanitie onely (as a man might ſay) <hi>per conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitantiam,</hi> as by relation to his deitie: then <hi>zelus</hi> (zeale) and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was the word of that ſufficient ſignificancie, to expreſſe what kind of loue, and ardent deſire, was, or ought to be in that ſubiect, wherein it was inherent: and ſo ſaid our Sauiour <hi>zelo zelatus ſum, &amp; deſiderio deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraui
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:20192:192"/> hoc paſcha manducare vobiſcum priuſquam moriar,</hi> &amp;c. Neither <hi>amor</hi> nor <hi>dilectio</hi> nor <hi>charitas</hi> being able, at full, to expreſſe with what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie of minde, and vehemencie of affection, our moſt milde, ſweete, and mercifull Ieſus, did thirſt after the ſauing health of our poore ſoules, that the diuell ſhould not triumph for euer ouer man, to the high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of his heauenly father: but as well in regarde of ſatisfaction to the diuine maieſtie, in rigor of his iuſtice: as alſo in reſpect of a redreſſe for mans miſeries, which could not be holpen, but by the full extent of his mercies towards him: that all parties ſhould be ſatisfied, the act to effect this withall, muſt in his proper eſſence, be an act of obedience, in a willing minde, to vndergoe, for that end and purpoſe, whatſoeuer ſhould be laid vpon our lord &amp; maſter his tender body for to carry; and that ſame act, we call zeale, in the higheſt degree of ardent deſire, of mercie and truth, iuſtice and peace to kiſſe together, and make attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt God and man.</p>
               <p>And as we finde this difference betwixt loue, charitie and zeale, to be oracled from thoſe diuine lips that knew beſt how to terme them: ſo although the ſame three may be and often are taken in an euil ſenſe, and therefore properly ſaid to be, ſome times in bad men, who doe things of indiſcreete zeale, fayned charity, and vnlawfull or mundane loue and affection: yet letting theſe paſſe, and taking all three, in a good ſenſe: although againe, we are not to imagine them to be, as they were in our Sauiour, in any mortall wight, without ſome imperfection, more or leſſe: yet do we finde them all, in as perfect a manner, as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſtate can affoord, in ſundry of Gods ſeruants during their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in this vale of teares: as all hiſtories, canonicall, apocriphall, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and prophane, beare witnes. For to omit the firſt tow gifts of grace, to wit Loue &amp; Charity: becauſe I muſt be briefe: and for that the third is the only one, which I am touched withal: for vſing inconſiderate ſpeech of indiſcreet zeale, as an acte of the will, wherein paſſion, chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or anger may be ſaid moſt to abound. Was not the act of <hi>Phynees</hi> done of mere zeale, when he thruſt the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> and <hi>Madianite</hi> quite through together for adultery? Was it not an act aboue ordinary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in perfection (as a ſpeciall vertue of another kind) when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid, <hi>Zelus domus Dei, comedit me.</hi> In which feruor of ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to haue God glorified, in puniſhing of the wicked: Did he not (<hi>Elias</hi> the Thesbite I meane) wiſh for fire to deſcend downe from heauen to conſume (and ſo it did) the two <hi>Quinquagenarian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, with their bands of ſouldiours, for their malignant ſcoffing and contempt of Gods ſeruants?

In fewe, when <hi>Moyſes</hi> the meekeſt man on earth, gaue one while charge for euery one to kill his next neighbour, father, mother, ſiſter, brother, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouer, without difference or exception of perſons: And an other while bewailed ſo the ſinnes of his people, that he praied vnto God, either to take away their offences, or elſe to take himſelfe out of the booke of life: it was an act of iuſtice directly in the firſt; and a point aboue ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie charitie in the ſecond; and both the one and the other proceeded of a true zeale of Gods honor; which the meeke <hi>Moyſes</hi> would not haue touched, no not though himſelfe were vtterly caſt out of fauor with the diuine maieſtie &amp;c. For ſuch ought to be all faithfull peoples reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that though they knew they ſhould be damned to hell without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; yet ſhoulde they not for that, the leſſe labour, to ſet foorth Gods honour heere on earth, as created to do Gods will in all things, and their owne in nothing contrarie to the will diuine. And the like was of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his ardent deſire, to be <hi>anathema pro fratribus ſecundum carnem,</hi> rather then to haue them wallow in ſinne, ſo as God ſhould be diſhonored thereby; as being forced to fruſtrate his diuine promiſes through the Iewes offences.</p>
               <p>Conformablie to the premiſes (deare catholikes) giue me leaue to enlarge my ſelfe a little in this acte of zeale.

And this free deliuery of my minde, humble confeſſion of mine owne cholericke humour, and vtter deteſtation of all partialitie, ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie, or what elſe ſoeuer may preiudice Gods honour, my countries weale, or common cauſe, or mine owne innocencie, as acting all mine actions <hi>in ſimplicitate cordis,</hi> of meere zeale <hi>(vtcunque)</hi> will I hope ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to take away all raſh, if not peremptory, prepoſterous and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant iealouſies had of me, for ſmelling of that I wil auerre with my dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt blood, to deteſt as much (if not more) as any ſuch preciſe cenſurers of my thoughts doe, or ſhall be poſſibly able to giue teſtimony of for their diſguſting of the ſame. And heere a little further to explane my minde (if ſtill you will turne zeale into choller in me, and reuenge into zeale in the Ieſuiticall faction: be pleaſed (deere catholikes) to remember that though all men came of one moulde, yet are they not all of one mettall, by reaſon of ſome aſpect, ſtarre, or planet ſhrowded in the skie, or of the clime, conſtellation, and influence, of the bodies celeſtiall, or other calculation, or naturall incline, taking after their parents, their ſite of birth, place of education, &amp;c. To all which, though will be free to yeelde or reſiſt for <hi>astra mouent ſed non cogunt</hi> (ſay the ſound diuines) yet doe thoſe motions worke, in ſome thus, in others ſo, and in all diuerſly; as the diuerſitie of natures doth incline them, in acts, either of chiefeſt zeale, or of morall, and naturall motion. And that as well in words, and writings, as in deedes and actions. As amongſt the poets laureate, <hi>Virgill</hi> hath a graue and loftie: <hi>Ouid</hi> a light and pleaſant; <hi>Horace</hi> a hearſh, biting and ſatiricall ſtile. Amongſt Orators we haue a ſententious <hi>Salust:</hi> a fluent <hi>Cicero:</hi> a thundring <hi>Demosthenes:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all eloquent, yet the laſt a full ſumd or conſumate Orator, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſo the reader, in the onely peruſe of his bookes, as the perplexed with his parlee, well perceiuing it, ſaid, <hi>viua voce</hi> with a deepe ſigh fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from an halfe dead hart: What are you afraid to reade? Yea but then, <hi>quid ſi audiuiſſes illam bestiam loquentem?</hi> As much to ſay, if you had ſeene and heard, as I haue the acts, geſtures, voice, words, and motion of the beaſt bent againſt you: how then would it haue moued you: <hi>viua vox</hi> hauing <hi>quandam energian</hi> in it, as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> noteth in that place. Amongſt Philoſophers <hi>Aristotle</hi> was wiſe, profound; <hi>Plato</hi> humane, diuine; <hi>Pythagoras</hi> hot, preciſe; and all ſound exquiſite naturians. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

Amongſt ſcholemen, <hi>Petrus Lumbardus</hi> pithie; <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> angelical: <hi>Dunſus Scotus,</hi> quipping and yet <hi>Doctor Subtilis.</hi> Amongſt the moſt famous preachers in Rome of later yeeres, three were rare, and all ſuperlatiues in a different kind: whereupon the adages, went thus on their behalfs. <hi>Tolletus docet, Lupus mouet, Panecrollus delectat.</hi> In few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Apoſtles Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was the onely vterine, and germane brother to Saint <hi>Andrew;</hi> and therefore by birth, bloud, and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neereſt linckt vnto him, of any other: but yet in Gods concurrence with ſecondarie cauſes, none did ſympathize ſo well nor came ſo neere together in nature of all the diſciples, as did the ſaid ſupreme Apoſtle, with the veſſell of choice election. Of which two it is ſong in the church agreeing to the purpoſe that <hi>glorioſi principes terrae, quomodo in vita ſua dilexeru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſe; ita &amp; in morte non ſint ſeparati.</hi> For the later of which his owne epiſtles make it manifeſt how chollerick (nay how exorbitant and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, if not hereticall, would a Ieſuite haue ſaid) he was. And howſoeuer it ſeemed that the firſt of theſe, had his emulators; euen of thoſe that were moſt modeſt, milde, humble, and charitable, fulre pleate with loue diuine as was the chaſt paranimph Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> our Sauiours loue, and our Ladies darling, yet doth Saint <hi>Peters</hi> acts ſet forth a greater zeale in him, then in Saint <hi>Iohn:</hi> and that he had an inclination to be of a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctique or of an actiue life as a gift required in an eccleſiaſticall or ſecular perſon euen of nature. And therefore was it, that, noting well how quick, hote, and haſtie he was, full of valour, actiuitie, and ſtoutnes, (as the ſoden motion ſhewed, in cutting of <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare, and after aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the queſtion, <hi>Domine ſi percutimus in gladio:</hi>) although it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our Sauiour to giue him a gentle checke, by his fall, to make him know him ſelfe, and to conſider that <hi>non in carneo brachio corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur, vir.</hi> yet did he neuer, after he was riſen, and reconciled to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and moſt mercifull redeemer againe; ſtoope, yeelde, or giue back one foote, in proſecuting Gods quarrell, and the churches cauſe; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of bothe their honours, remaining reſolute, conſtant, and inuicted of mind, therein to death; euen with the ſame valorous hart, he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The old ſaying being truely verified in him, that <hi>naturam expellas furca licet vſque recurret:</hi> the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> can not change his skin: <hi>&amp; cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt:</hi> And be it in good, or bad ſenſe taken, yet is the definitiue ſentence in humane actions true, that nature hath her inclinations to this or that, according to the humour of the ſubiect: which though it may be altered, changed, and turned to good, or euill; to vertue or vice, to well or woe: by reaſon of free will, and grace diuine, relinquiſhing, or aſſiſting the internall acts, in acting of their externall actions, to produce the effects intended: yet nature
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:20192:194"/> alwaies muſt, and will haue her ſwinge, in the progreſſe, and manner of proceeding, thus or ſo, as courſe of kinde inclines her. And euen ſo is it with me, in this bitter kind of writing: which my ſharpe cenſurers might haue pleaſed of their charitie, to haue interpreted, as proceeding if not from an abſolute perfect zeale, yet from an act of zeale <hi>(vtcumque)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with choller, or anger at their impietie: but neuer to ſmell of hereſie, as I wil auerre it at a ſtake, againſt the pureſt prowd ſpirited Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite among them, that will or dare vndertake the quarrell for diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſpirits (wherof they boaſt) to try who ſmels, or ſtincks moſt vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of hereſie; they in pernitious vſurpate cenſure of me: or I, in defence of whatſoeuer I haue written alwaies with, in, and vnder ſubmiſſion to our holy mother the catholike Romane church, in all humble wiſe. What ſhould I ſay more (deere catholiks) there are three internall parts or portions mixt of fleſh and ſpirit, and naturally inſerted in euery man, to wit, <hi>pars iraſcibilis, pars concupiſcibilis, pars rationabilis:</hi> and yet are they not all, nor any of them, predominant in all men equally and alike: not all alike wittie; not all alike affectionate; not all alike an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, or eaſie to be mooued, and againe appeaſed: and euen all this by reaſon of natures gifts (abſtracted from grace diuine, <hi>in corpore organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zato</hi>) diſpoſed in one thus, in an other ſo, in a third otherwiſe. All mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wights conſiſt of fower elements, qualities, or humors, which raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in man, make al men and women vpright humoriſts (leſſe or more) in their proper kinde; agreeing to the humour or element predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and yet it is neither a fit conſequent, to inferre all Spaniards to be chollerike, becauſe borne vnder the hotte fierie clime: nor all Scots melancholy, becauſe bred &amp; brought vp in the cold <hi>Orchadiam Iles,</hi> or betwixt <hi>Cheneal hils,</hi> and <hi>Feynd felles,</hi> in the bateable grounds, waſtes, or borders. And for me (deare catholikes) borne far in the north (and yet neither of a white liuer, nor melancholy complexion) giue me leaue in this one thing to follow the motion of grace diuine (I hope) or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of proper kind at leaſt.<note place="margin">Note that euery one hath ſome word, or phraſe of ſpeech to know the author by, as more vſuall with him or her then with any other: So father <hi>Parſons</hi> his bookes and writings is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by this phraſe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by vſing much this ſpeech <hi>(as all the world knoweth)</hi> which is to be ſeene in his <hi>Greenecote</hi> in his <hi>Doleman,</hi> &amp;c.</note>
